Overview
--------

The purpose of an InputState is to receive and combine inputs to a `Mechanism`, allow them to be modified, and provide
them to the Mechanism's `function <Mechanism_Base.function>`. An InputState receives input to a `Mechanism`
provided by the `Projections <Projection>` to that Mechanism from others in a `Process` or `System`.  If the
InputState belongs to an `ORIGIN` Mechanism (see `role of Mechanisms in Processes and Systems
<Mechanism_Role_In_Processes_And_Systems>`), then it receives the input specified when that Process or System is
`run <Run>`.  The `PathwayProjections <PathWayProjection>` received by an InputState are listed in its `path_afferents
<InputState.path_afferents>`, and its `ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>` in its `mod_afferents
<InputState.mod_afferents>` attribute.  Its `function <InputState.function>` combines the values received from its
PathWayProjections, modifies the combined value according to value(s) any ModulatoryProjections it receives, and
provides the result to the assigned item of its owner Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` and
`input_values <Mechanism_Base.input_values>` attributes (see `below` and `Mechanism InputStates <Mechanism_InputStates>`
for additional details about the role of InputStates in Mechanisms, and their assignment to the items of a Mechanism's
`variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute).

.. _InputState_Creation:

Creating an InputState
----------------------

An InputState can be created by calling its constructor, but in general this is not necessary as a Mechanism can
usually automatically create the InputState(s) it needs when it is created.  For example, if the Mechanism is
being created within the `pathway <Process.pathway` of a `Process`, its InputState will be created and  assigned
as the `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` of a `MappingProjection` from the  preceding `Mechanism <Mechanism>` in
the `pathway <Process.pathway>`.  If it is created using its constructor, and a Mechanism is specified in the
**owner** argument, it is automatically assigned to that Mechanism.  If the **owner* is not specified, `initialization
is deferred.

.. _InputState_Deferred_Initialization:

Owner Assignment and Deferred Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An InputState must be owned by a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`.  When InputState is specified in the constructor for a
Mechanism (see `below <InputState_Specification>`), it is automatically assigned to that Mechanism as its owner. If
the InputState is created directly, its `owner <InputState.owner>` can specified in the **owner**  argument of its
constructor, in which case it will be assigned to that Mechanism. Otherwise, its initialization will be
`deferred <State_Deferred_Initialization>` until
COMMENT:
TBI: its `owner <State_Base.owner>` attribute is assigned or
COMMENT
the InputState is assigned to a Mechanism using the Mechanism's `add_states <Mechanism_Base.add_states>` method.

.. _InputState_Primary:

Primary InputState
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every Mechanism has at least one InputState, referred to as its *primary InputState*.  If InputStates are not
`explicitly specified <InputState_Specification>` for a Mechanism, a primary InputState is automatically created
and assigned to its `input_state <Mechanism_Base.input_state>` attribute (note the singular), and also to the first
entry of the Mechanism's `input_states <Mechanism_Base.input_states>` attribute (note the plural).  The `value
<InputState.value>` of the primary InputState is assigned as the first (and often only) item of the Mechanism's
`variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` and `input_values <Mechanism_Base.input_values>` attributes.

.. _InputState_Specification:

InputState Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specifying InputStates when a Mechanism is created
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

InputStates can be specified for a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` when it is created, in the **input_states** argument of the
Mechanism's constructor (see `examples <State_Constructor_Argument_Examples>` in State), or in an *INPUT_STATES* entry
of a parameter dictionary assigned to the constructor's **params** argument.  The latter takes precedence over the
former (that is, if an *INPUT_STATES* entry is included in the parameter dictionary, any specified in the
**input_states** argument are ignored).

    .. _InputState_Replace_Default_Note:

    .. note::
       Assigning InputStates to a Mechanism in its constructor **replaces** any that are automatically generated for
       that Mechanism (i.e., those that it creates for itself by default).  If any of those are needed, they must be
       explicitly specified in the list assigned to the **input_states** argument, or the *INPUT_STATES* entry of the
       parameter dictionary in the **params** argument.  The number of InputStates specified must also be equal to
       the number of items in the Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute.

.. _InputState_Variable_and_Value:

Each InputState specified in the **input_states** argument must correspond to an item of the Mechanism's `variable
<Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute (see `Mechanism InputStates <Mechanism_InputStates>`), and the `value
<InputState.value>` of the InputState must be compatible with that item (that is, have the same number and type of
elements).  By default, this is also true of the InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>` attribute,
since the default `function <InputState.function>` for an InputState is a `LinearCombination`, the purpose of which
is to combine the inputs it receives and possibly modify the combined value (under the influence of any
`ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>` it receives), but **not mutate its form**. Therefore, under most
circumstances, both the `variable <InputState.variable>` of an InputState and its `value <InputState.value>` should
match the item of its owner's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` to which the InputState is assigned.

The format of an InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>` can be specified in a variety of ways.  The most
straightforward is in the **variable** argument of its constructor.  More commonly, however, it is determined by
the context in which it is being created, such as the specification for its owner Mechanism's `variable
<Mechanism_Base.variable>` or for the InputState in the Mechanism's **input_states** argument (see `below
<InputState_Forms_of_Specification>` and `Mechanism InputState specification <Mechanism_InputState_Specification>`
for details).


Adding InputStates to a Mechanism after it is created
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

InputStates can also be **added** to a Mechanism, either by creating the InputState on its own, and specifying the
Mechanism in the InputState's **owner** argument, or by using the Mechanism's `add_states <Mechanism_Base.add_states>`
method (see `examples <State_Create_State_Examples>` in State).

    .. _InputState_Add_State_Note:

    .. note::
       Adding InputStates *does not replace* any that the Mechanism generates by default;  rather they are added to the
       Mechanism, and appended to the list of InputStates in its `input_states <Mechanism_Base>` attribute. Importantly,
       the Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute is extended with items that correspond to the
       `value <InputState.value>` attribute of each added InputState.  This may affect the relationship of the
       Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` to its `function <Mechanism_Base.function>`, as well as the
       number of its `OutputStates <OutputState>` (see `note <Mechanism_Add_InputStates_Note>`).

If the name of an InputState added to a Mechanism is the same as one that already exists, its name will be suffixed
with a numerical index (incremented for each InputState with that name; see `Naming`), and the InputState will be
added to the list (that is, it will *not* replace ones that already exist).

.. _InputState_Forms_of_Specification:

Forms of Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

InputStates can be specified in a variety of ways, that fall into three broad categories:  specifying an InputState
directly; by an `OutputState` or `Projection` that should project to it; or by using a `State specification dictionary
<State_Specification>` or tuple format to specify attributes for the InputState (including Projections to it). Each of
these is described below:

    .. _InputState_Direct_Specification:

    **Direct Specification**

    * existing **InputState object** or the name of one -- if used to specify an InputState in the constructor for a
      Mechanism, its `value <InputState.value>` must be compatible with the corresponding item of the owner Mechanism's
      `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` (see `Mechanism InputState specification
      <Mechanism_InputState_Specification>`).
    ..
    * **InputState class**, **keyword** *INPUT_STATE*, or a **string** -- this creates a default InputState; if used
      to specify an InputState in the constructor for a Mechanism, the item of the owner Mechanism's `variable
      <Mechanism_Base.variable>` to which the InputState is assigned is used as the format for the InputState`s
      `variable <InputState.variable>`; otherwise, the default for the InputState will be used.  If a string is
      specified, it is used as the `name <InputState.name>` of the InputState (see `example
      <State_Constructor_Argument_Examples>`).
    ..
    * **value** -- this creates a default InputState using the specified value as the InputState's `variable
      <InputState.variable>`; if used to specify an InputState in the constructor for a Mechanism, the format must be
      compatible with the corresponding item of the owner Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` (see
      `Mechanism InputState specification <Mechanism_InputState_Specification>` and `example
      <State_Value_Spec_Example>`).

    .. _InputState_OutputState_Specification:

    **OutputState or Projection Specification**

    * **OutputState** -- a reference to an existing `OutputState`;  this creates an InputState and a
      MappingProjection to it from the specified OutputState.  By default, the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`
      is used to format the InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>`, and an `IDENTITY_MATRIX` is used for the
      MappingProjection.  However, if **default_variable** argument is specified in the constructor for the InputState's
      owner Mechanism, then the corresponding item of its value is used as the format for the InputState's `variable
      <InputState.variable>`, and `AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX` is used for the MappingProjection, which adjusts its `value
      <Projection_Base.value>` to match the InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>`.

    * **Mechanism** -- the Mechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` is used, and the InputState
      (and MappingProjection to it) are created as for an OutputState specification (see above).
    ..
    * **Projection object**.  this creates a default InputState and assigns it as the `Projection's <Projection>`
      `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`;  the Projection's `value <Projection_Base.value>` must be compatible with
      the item of the owner Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` to which the InputState is assigned.
    ..
    * **Projection subclass** -- this creates a default InputState, formattig its `variable <InputState.variable>`
      in the same manner as an InputState class, keyword or string (see above), and using this as the format for the
      Projection's `value <Projection_Base.value>`.  Since the Projection's `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` is
      unspecified, its `initialization is deferred <Projection_Deferred_Initialization>`.  In some cases, initialization
      can happen automatically -- for example, when a `ControlProjection` is created for the parameter of a Mechanism
      that is included in a `System`, a `ControlSignal` is created as the Projection's `sender <Projection_Base.sender>`
      that is added to the System's `controller <System.controller>` (see `System Control <System_Control>`).  However,
      for cases in which `deferred initialization <Component_Deferred_Init>` is not automatically completed,
      the Projection will not be operational until its `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` has been specified and its
      initialization completed.

    .. _InputState_Specification_Dictionary:

    **InputState Specification Dictionary or Tuple**

    * **InputState specification dictionary** -- this can be used to specify the attributes of an InputState,
      using any of the entries that can be included in a `State specification dictionary <State_Specification>`
      (see `examples <State_Specification_Dictionary_Examples>` in State), as well as well as the following entries
      specific to an InputState:

      * *WEIGHT*:<number>
          the value must be an integer or float, and is assigned as the value of the InputState's `weight
          <InputState.weight>` attribute (see `weight and exponent <InputState_Weights_And_Exponents>`);
          this takes precedence over any specification in the **weight** argument of the InputState's constructor.
      ..
      * *EXPONENT*:<number>
          the value must be an integer or float, and is assigned as the value of the InputState's `exponent
          <InputState.exponent>` attribute (see `weight and exponent <InputState_Weights_And_Exponents>`);
          this takes precedence over any specification in the **exponent** argument of the InputState's constructor.

      .. _InputState_Projections_Specification:

      If the dictionary is used to specify an InputState in the constructor for a Mechanism, and it includes a
      *VARIABLE* and/or *VALUE* or entry, the value must be compatible with the item of the owner Mechanism's `variable
      <Mechanism_Base.variable>` to which the InputState is assigned (see  `Mechanism InputState specification
      <Mechanism_InputState_Specification>`). If a *PROJECTIONS* entry is included, it can include one or more
      `OutputState` and/or `MappingProjection` specifications for OutputStates that should project to it, as well one
      or more `ModulatorySignal` and/or `ModulatoryProjection` specifications for ModulatorySignals that should
      project to it (see `examples <State_Projections_Examples>` in State).  If these are used to specify the
      InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>` (see `note below <InputState_Projection_Specification>`) within
      the constructor for a Mechanism, then again this must be compatible with the corresponding item of the
      Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>`.

   .. _InputState_Tuple_Specification:

    * **Tuple specification** -- this is a convenience format that can be used to compactly specify an InputState
      along with a Projection to it.  It can take several forms:

        * **2-item tuple** -- the first item can be either a value (specifying the `variable <InputState.variable>` for
          the InputState, or a Mechanism or OutputState specification indicating an OutputState that should project to
          it (see above); the second item must be a `Projection specification <Projection_Specification>`. This creates
          an InputState and the specified Projection.  If the Projection is a `MappingProjection`, its `value
          <Projection_Base.value>` is used to format of the InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>` (see `note
          <InputState_Projection_Specification>` below); if this occurs within the constructor for a Mechanism, it must
          be compatible with the corresponding item of the Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>`.  The
          InputState is assigned as the Projection's `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>` and, if the first item
          specifies an  OutputState, that is assigned as the Projection's `sender <Projection_Base.sender>`.  If the
          specification is for `ModulatoryProjection`, it is created (along with a corresponding `ModulatorySignal`)
          if necessary, the InputState is assigned as its `receiver <ModulatoryProjection.receiver>`, and the the
          Projection is assigned to the InputState's `mod_afferents <InputState>` attribute.

        * **ConnectionTuple** -- this is an expanded version of the 2-item tuple that allows the specification of the
          `weight <InputState.weight>` and/or `exponent <InputState.exponent>` attributes of the InputState, as well as
          a Projection to it. Each tuple must have at least the three following items (in the order listed), and can
          include the fourth:

            * **State specification** -- specifies either the `variable <InputState.variable>` of the InputState, or a
              specification for an OutputState (see above) that should project to it, which must be consistent with
              the Projection specified in the fourth item if that is included (see below);
            |
            * **weight** -- must be an integer or a float; multiplies the `value <InputState.value>` of the InputState
              before it is combined with others by the Mechanism's `function <Mechanism.function>` (see
              ObjectiveMechanism for `examples <ObjectiveMechanism_Weights_and_Exponents_Example>`);
            |
            * **exponent** -- must be an integer or float; exponentiates the `value <InputState.value>` of the
              InputState before it is combined with others by the ObjectiveMechanism's `function
              <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` (see ObjectiveMechanism for `examples
              <ObjectiveMechanism_Weights_and_Exponents_Example>`);
            |
            * **Projection specification** (optional) -- `specifies a Projection <Projection_Specification>` in the
              same manner as the second item of a 2-item tuple (see above);  it's `sender <Projection_Base.sender>`
              must be compatible with the specification in the first item (i.e., for either the `variable
              <InputState.variable>` of the InputState, or the `value <OutputState.value>` of the OutputState
              specified to project to it.

              .. _InputState_Projection_Specification:

              .. note::
                 If a Projection specification is for a `MappingProjection`, it can use the Projection itself or a
                 `matrix specification <Mapping_Matrix_Specification>`.  If it is a Projection, then its `value
                 <Projection_Base.value>` is used to determine the InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>`; if
                 it is a matrix, then its receiver dimensionality determines the format of the InputState's `variable
                 <InputState.variable>`. For a standard 2d weight matrix (i.e., one that maps a 1d array from its
                 `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` to a 1d array of its `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`), the
                 receiver dimensionality is its outer dimension (axis 1, or its number of columns).  However, if
                 the `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` has more than one dimension, then the dimensionality of the
                 receiver (used for the InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>`) is the dimensionality of the
                 matrix minus the dimensionality of the sender's `value <OutputState.value>`.

.. _InputState_Projections:

Projections
~~~~~~~~~~~

When an InputState is created, it can be assigned one or more `Projections <Projection>`, using either the
**projections** argument of its constructor, or in an entry of a dictionary assigned to the **params** argument with
the key *PROJECTIONS*.  An InputState can be assigned either `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` or
`GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>`.  MappingProjections are assigned to its `path_afferents
<InputState.path_afferents>` attribute and GatingProjections to its `mod_afferents <InputState.mod_afferents>`
attribute.  See `State Projections <State_Projections>` for additional details concerning the specification of
Projections when creating a State.


.. _InputState_Structure:

Structure
---------

Every InputState is owned by a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`. It can receive one or more `MappingProjections
<MappingProjection>` from other Mechanisms, as well as from the Process or System to which its owner belongs (if it
is the `ORIGIN` Mechanism for that Process or System).  It has the following attributes, that includes ones specific
to, and that can be used to customize the InputState:

* `projections <OutputState.projections>` -- all of the `Projections <Projection>` received by the InputState.

.. _InputState_Afferent_Projections:

* `path_afferents <InputState.path_afferents>` -- `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` that project to the
  InputState, the `value <MappingProjection.value>`\\s of which are combined by the InputState's `function
  <InputState.function>`, possibly modified by its `mod_afferents <InputState_mod_afferents>`, and assigned to the
  corresponding item of the owner Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>`.
..
* `mod_afferents <InputState_mod_afferents>` -- `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` that project to the InputState,
  the `value <GatingProjection.value>` of which can modify the InputState's `value <InputState.value>` (see the
  descriptions of Modulation under `ModulatorySignals <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` and `GatingSignals
  <GatingSignal_Modulation>` for additional details).  If the InputState receives more than one GatingProjection,
  their values are combined before they are used to modify the `value <InputState.value>` of InputState.

.. _InputState_Variable:

* `variable <InputState.variable>` -- serves as the template for the `value <Projection_Base.value>` of the
  `Projections <Projection>` received by the InputState:  each must be compatible with (that is, match both the
  number and type of elements of) the InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>`. In general, this must also be
  compatible with the item of the owner Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` to which the InputState is
  assigned (see `above <InputState_Variable_and_Value>` and `Mechanism InputState
  specification <Mechanism_InputState_Specification>`).

.. _InputState_Function:

* `function <InputState.function>` -- aggregates the `value <Projection_Base.value>` of all of the
  `Projections <Projection>` received by the InputState, and assigns the result to the InputState's `value
  <InputState.value>` attribute.  The default function is `LinearCombination` that performs an elementwise (Hadamard)
  sums the values. However, the parameters of the `function <InputState.function>` -- and thus the `value
  <InputState.value>` of the InputState -- can be modified by any `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by
  the InputState (listed in its `mod_afferents <InputState.mod_afferents>` attribute.  A custom function can also be
  specified, so long as it generates a result that is compatible with the item of the Mechanism's `variable
  <Mechanism_Base.variable>` to which the `InputState is assigned <Mechanism_InputStates>`.

.. _InputState_Value:

* `value <InputState.value>` -- the result returned by its `function <InputState.function>`,
  after aggregating the value of the `PathProjections <PathwayProjection>` it receives, possibly modified by any
  `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the InputState. It must be compatible with the
  item of the owner Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` to which the `InputState has been assigned
  <Mechanism_InputStates>` (see `above <InputState_Variable_and_Value>` and `Mechanism InputState specification
  <Mechanism_InputState_Specification>`).

.. _InputState_Weights_And_Exponents:

* `weight <InputState.weight>` and `exponent <InputState.exponent>` -- these can be used by the Mechanism to which the
  InputState belongs when that combines the `value <InputState.value>`\\s of its States (e.g., an ObjectiveMechanism
  uses the weights and exponents assigned to its InputStates to determine how the values it monitors are combined by
  its `function <ObjectiveMechanism>`).  The value of each must be an integer or float, and the default is 1 for both.

.. _InputState_Execution:

Execution
---------

An InputState cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the Mechanism to which it belongs is executed.
When this occurs, the InputState executes any `Projections <Projection>` it receives, calls its `function
<InputState.function>` to aggregate the values received from any `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` it receives
(listed in its its `path_afferents  <InputState.path_afferents>` attribute) and modulate them in response to any
`GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` (listed in its `mod_afferents <InputState.mod_afferents>` attribute),
and then assigns the result to the InputState's `value <InputState.value>` attribute. This, in turn, is assigned to
the item of the Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` and `input_values <Mechanism_Base.input_values>`
attributes  corresponding to that InputState (see `Mechanism Variable and InputStates
<Mechanism_Variable_and_InputStates>` for additional details).

    Subclass of `State <State>` that calculates and represents the input to a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` from one or more
    `PathwayProjection <PathwayProjection>`.

    COMMENT:

        Description
        -----------
            The InputState class is a Component type in the State category of Function,
            Its FUNCTION executes the Projections that it receives and updates the InputState's value

        Class attributes
        ----------------
            + componentType (str) = INPUT_STATE
            + paramClassDefaults (dict)
                + FUNCTION (LinearCombination, Operation.SUM)
                + FUNCTION_PARAMS (dict)
                # + kwStateProjectionAggregationFunction (LinearCombination, Operation.SUM)
                # + kwStateProjectionAggregationMode (LinearCombination, Operation.SUM)

        Class methods
        -------------
            _instantiate_function: insures that function is ARITHMETIC)
            update_state: gets InputStateParams and passes to super (default: LinearCombination with Operation.SUM)

        StateRegistry
        -------------
            All INPUT_STATE are registered in StateRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances

    COMMENT


    Arguments
    ---------

    owner : Mechanism
        the Mechanism to which the InputState belongs;  it must be specified or determinable from the context in which
        the InputState is created.

    reference_value : number, list or np.ndarray
        the value of the item of the owner Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute to which
        the InputState is assigned; used as the template for the InputState's `value <InputState.value>` attribute.

    variable : number, list or np.ndarray
        specifies the template for the InputState's `variable <InputState.variable>` attribute.

    function : Function or method : default LinearCombination(operation=SUM)
        specifies the function used to aggregate the `values <Projection_Base.value>` of the `Projections <Projection>`
        received by the InputState, under the possible influence of `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received
        by the InputState.  It must produce a result that has the same format (number and type of elements) as the
        item of its owner Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` to which the InputState has been assigned.

    projections : list of Projection specifications
        species the `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` and/or `GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>` to be
        received by the InputState, and that will be listed in its `path_afferents <InputState.path_afferents>` and
        `mod_afferents <InputState.mod_afferents>` attributes, respectively (see `InputState_Projections` for additional
        details).

    weight : number : default 1
        specifies the value of the `weight <InputState.weight>` attribute of the InputState.

    exponent : number : default 1
        specifies the value of the `exponent <InputState.exponent>` attribute of the InputState.

    params : Dict[param keyword, param value] : default None
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the InputState or its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters. Values specified for parameters in
        the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default see `name <InputState.name>`
        specifies the name of the InputState; see InputState `name <InputState.name>` for details.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : default State.classPreferences
        specifies the `PreferenceSet` for the InputState; see `prefs <InputState.prefs>` for details.


    Attributes
    ----------

    owner : Mechanism
        the Mechanism to which the InputState belongs.

    path_afferents : List[MappingProjection]
        `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` that project to the InputState
        (i.e., for which it is a `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`).

    mod_afferents : List[GatingProjection]
        `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` that project to the InputState.

    projections : List[Projection]
        all of the `Projections <Projection>` received by the InputState.

    variable : value, list or np.ndarray
        the template for the `value <Projection_Base.value>` of each Projection that the InputState receives,
        each of which must match the format (number and types of elements) of the InputState's
        `variable <InputState.variable>`.

    size : int, list or np.ndarray of ints
        specifies variable as array(s) of zeros if **variable** is not passed as an argument;
        if **variable** is specified, it takes precedence over the specification of **size**.
        As an example, the following mechanisms are equivalent::
            T1 = TransferMechanism(size = [3, 2])
            T2 = TransferMechanism(default_variable = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0]])

    function : CombinationFunction : default LinearCombination(operation=SUM))
        performs an element-wise (Hadamard) aggregation of the `value <Projection_Base.value>` of each Projection
        received by the InputState, under the possible influence of any `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received
        by the InputState.

    value : value or ndarray
        the output of the InputState's `function <InputState.function>`, which is the the aggregated value of the
        `PathwayProjections <PathwayProjection>` (e.g., `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`) received by the
        InputState (and listed in its `path_afferents <InputState.path_afferents>` attribute), possibly `modulated
        <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` by any `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` it receives (listed in its
        `mod_afferents <InputState.mod_afferents>` attribute).  The result (whether a value or an ndarray) is
        assigned to an item of the owner Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>`.

    weight : number
        see `weight and exponent <InputState_Weights_And_Exponents>` for description.

    exponent : number
        see `weight and exponent <InputState_Weights_And_Exponents>` for description.

    name : str
        the name of the InputState; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a default is
        assigned by the InputStateRegistry of the Mechanism to which the InputState belongs.  Note that some Mechanisms
        automatically create one or more non-default InputStates, that have pre-specified names.  However, if any
        InputStates are specified in the **input_states** argument of the Mechanism's constructor, those replace those
        InputStates (see `note <Mechanism_Default_State_Suppression_Note>`), and `standard naming conventions <Naming>`
        apply to the InputStates specified, as well as any that are added to the Mechanism once it is created.

        .. note::
            Unlike other PsyNeuLink components, State names are "scoped" within a Mechanism, meaning that States with
            the same name are permitted in different Mechanisms.  However, they are *not* permitted in the same
            Mechanism: States within a Mechanism with the same base name are appended an index in the order of their
            creation.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the InputState; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of the
        constructor, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :doc:`PreferenceSet
        <LINK>` for details).
