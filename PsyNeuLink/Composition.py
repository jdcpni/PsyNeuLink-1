      * `Composition_Overview`

.. _Composition_Overview:

Overview
--------

Composition is the base class for objects that combine PsyNeuLink `Components <Component>` into an executable model.
It defines a common set of attributes possessed, and methods used by all Composition objects.

.. _Composition_Creation:

Creating a Composition
----------------------

A generic Composition can be created by calling the constructor, and then adding `Components <Component>` using the
Composition's add methods.  However, more commonly, a Composition is created using the constructor for one of its
subclasses:  `System` or `Process`.  These automatically create Compositions from lists of Components.  Once created,
Components can be added or removed from an existing Composition using its add and/or remove methods.

class MechanismRole(Enum):
    """

    - ORIGIN
        A `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>` that is the first Mechanism of a `Process` and/or `System`,
        and that receives the input to the Process or System when it is :ref:`executed or run <Run>`.  A Process may
        have only one `ORIGIN` Mechanism, but a System may have many.  Note that the `ORIGIN`
        Mechanism of a Process is not necessarily an `ORIGIN` of the System to which it belongs, as it may receiver
        `Projections <Projection>` from other Processes in the System. The `ORIGIN` Mechanisms of a Process or
        System are listed in its :keyword:`origin_mechanisms` attribute, and can be displayed using its :keyword:`show`
        method.  For additional details about `ORIGIN` Mechanisms in Processes, see
        `Process Mechanisms <Process_Mechanisms>` and `Process Input and Output <Process_Input_And_Output>`;
        and for Systems see `System Mechanisms <System_Mechanisms>` and
        `System Input and Initialization <System_Execution_Input_And_Initialization>`.

    - INTERNAL
        A `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>` that is not designated as having any other status.

    - CYCLE
        A `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>` that is *not* an `ORIGIN` Mechanism, and receives a `Projection`
        that closes a recurrent loop in a `Process` and/or `System`.  If it is an `ORIGIN` Mechanism, then it is simply
        designated as such (since it will be assigned input and therefore be initialized in any event).

    - INITIALIZE_CYCLE
        A `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>` that is the `sender <Projection.Projection.sender>` of a
        `Projection` that closes a loop in a `Process` or `System`, and that is not an `ORIGIN` Mechanism (since in
        that case it will be initialized in any event). An `initial value  <Run_InitialValues>` can be assigned to such
        Mechanisms, that will be used to initialize the Process or System when it is first run.  For additional
        information, see `Run <Run_Initial_Values>`, `System Mechanisms <System_Mechanisms>` and
        `System Input and Initialization <System_Execution_Input_And_Initialization>`.

    - TERMINAL
        A `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>` that is the last Mechanism of a `Process` and/or `System`, and
        that provides the output to the Process or System when it is `executed or run <Run>`.  A Process may
        have only one `TERMINAL` mechanism, but a system may have many.  Note that the `TERMINAL`
        mechanism of a process is not necessarily a `TERMINAL` mechanism of the system to which it belongs,
        as it may send projections to other processes in the system.  The `TERMINAL` mechanisms of a process
        or system are listed in its :keyword:`terminalMechanisms` attribute, and can be displayed using its
        :keyword:`show` method.  For additional details about `TERMINAL` mechanisms in processes, see
        `Process_Mechanisms` and `Process_Input_And_Output`; and for systems see `System_Mechanisms`.

    - SINGLETON
        A `ProcessingMechanism` that is the only Mechanism in a `Process` and/or `System`.  It can serve the
        functions of an `ORIGIN` and/or a `TERMINAL` Mechanism.

    - MONITORED
        .

    - LEARNING
        A `LearningMechanism <LearningMechanism>` in a `Process` and/or `System`.

    - TARGET
        A `ComparatorMechanism` of a `Process` and/or `System` configured for learning that receives a target value
        from its `execute <ComparatorMechanism.ComparatorMechanism.execute>` or
        `run <ComparatorMechanism.ComparatorMechanism.execute>` method.  It must be associated with the `TERMINAL`
        Mechanism of the Process or System. The `TARGET` Mechanisms of a Process or System are listed in its
        :keyword:`target_mechanisms` attribute, and can be displayed using its :keyword:`show` method.  For additional
        details, see `TARGET mechanisms <LearningProjection_Targets>` and specifying `target values <Run_Targets>`.

            Passes inputs to any mechanisms receiving inputs directly from the user, then coordinates with the scheduler
            to receive and execute sets of mechanisms that are eligible to run until termination conditions are met.

            Arguments
            ---------

            inputs: { `Mechanism` : list }
                a dictionary containing a key-value pair for each mechanism in the composition that receives inputs from
                the user. For each pair, the key is the Mechanism and the value is a list of inputs. Each input in the list \
                corresponds to a certain `TRIAL`

            scheduler_processing : Scheduler
                the scheduler object which owns the conditions that will instruct the non-learning execution of this Composition. \
                If not specified, the Composition will use its automatically generated scheduler

            scheduler_learning : Scheduler
                the scheduler object which owns the conditions that will instruct the Learning execution of this Composition. \
                If not specified, the Composition will use its automatically generated scheduler

            execution_id : UUID
                execution_id will typically be set to none and assigned randomly at runtime

            num_trials : int
                typically, the composition will infer the number of trials from the length of its input specification.
                To reuse the same inputs across many trials, you may specify an input dictionary with lists of length 1,
                or use default inputs, and select a number of trials with num_trials.

            call_before_time_step : callable
                will be called before each `TIME_STEP` is executed

            call_after_time_step : callable
                will be called after each `TIME_STEP` is executed

            call_before_pass : callable
                will be called before each `PASS` is executed

            call_after_pass : callable
                will be called after each `PASS` is executed

            call_before_trial : callable
                will be called before each `TRIAL` is executed

            call_after_trial : callable
                will be called after each `TRIAL` is executed
