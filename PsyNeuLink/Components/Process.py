.. _Process_Overview:

Overview
--------

A Process is a `Composition` that is a sequence of `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` linked by `Projections <Projection>`.
Executing a Process executes all of its Mechanisms in the order in which they are listed in its `pathway` attribute:
a list of Mechanism and (optional) Projection specifications.  Projections can be specified among any Mechanisms in a
Process, including to themselves.  However, a Process cannot involve any "branching" (that is, one-to-many or
many-to-one Projections); that must be done using a `System`. Mechanisms in a Process can also project to Mechanisms
in other Processes, but these will only have an effect if all of the Processes involved are members of the same
`System`. Projections between Mechanisms can be trained, by assigning `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` to
them. Learning can also be specified for the entire Process, in which case all of the Projections among Mechanisms in
the Process will be trained. Processes can be constructed and executed on their own.  More commonly, however,
they are used to construct a `System`.

.. _Process_Creation:

Creating a Process
------------------

A Process is created by calling the :py:func:`process` function. The Mechanisms to be included are specified in a list
in the `pathway` argument, in the order in which they should be executed by the Process.  The Mechanism entries can be
separated by `projections <Projection>` used to connect them.  If no arguments are provided to the `pathway` argument,
a Process with a single `default_mechanism <Mechanism_Base.default_mechanism>` is created.

.. _Process_Structure:

Structure
---------

.. _Process_Pathway:

Pathway
~~~~~~~

A Process is defined primarily by its `pathway` attribute, which is a list of `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` and
`Projections <Projection>`.  The list defines an array of Mechanisms that will executed in the order specified. Each
Mechanism in the pathway must project at least to the next one in the pathway, though it can project to others and
also receive recurrent (feedback) Projections from them.  However, pathways cannot be used to construct branching
patterns;  that requires the use of a  `System`.  The Mechanisms specified in the `pathway` for a Process are generally
`ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>`.  The projections between Mechanisms in a Process must be
`MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`.  These transmit the output of a Mechanism (the Projection's
`sender <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.sender>`) to the input of another Mechanism (the Projection's
`receiver <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.receiver>`). Specification of a `pathway` requires, at the least, a list
of Mechanisms.  These can be specified directly, or in a **tuple** that also contains a set of
`runtime parameters <Mechanism_Runtime_Parameters>` (see `below <Process_Mechanism_Specification>`). Projections
between a pair of Mechanisms can be specified by interposing them in the list between the pair.  When no Projection
appears between two adjacent Mechanisms in the pathway, and there is no otherwise specified Projection between them,
PsyNeuLink assigns a default Projection. Specifying the components of a pathway is described in detail below.

.. _Process_Mechanisms:

Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~

The `Mechanisms` of a Process must be listed in the `pathway` argument of the :py:func:`process` function explicitly,
in the order to be executed.  The first Mechanism in the Process is designated as the `ORIGIN`, and receives as its
input any input provided to the Process' `execute <Process_Base.execute>` or `run <Process_Base.run>` methods. The last
Mechanism listed in the `pathway` is designated as the `TERMINAL` Mechanism, and its output is assigned as the output
of the Process when it is executed.

.. note::
   The `ORIGIN` and `TERMINAL` Mechanisms of a Process are not necessarily the `ORIGIN` and/or `TERMINAL` Mechanisms
   of the `System(s) <System_Mechanisms>` to which it belongs.  The designations of a Mechanism's status in the
   Process(es) to which it belongs are listed in its `Processes <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.processes>` attribute.

.. _Process_Mechanism_Specification:

Mechanisms can be specified in the `pathway` argument of :py:func:`process` in one of two ways:  directly or
in a *MechanismTuple*.  Direct  specification can use any supported format for
`specifying a Mechanism <Mechanism_Creation>`. Alternatively, Mechanisms can be specified using a MechanismTuple,
the first item of which is the Mechanism, and the second is a set of
`runtime parameters <Mechanism_Runtime_Parameters>`. Runtime parameters are used for that Mechanism when the Process
(or a System to which it belongs) is executed; otherwise they do not remain associated with the Mechanism. The same
Mechanism can appear more than once in a `pathway`, as one means of generating a recurrent processing loop (another
is to specify this in the Projections -- see below).


.. _Process_Projections:

Projections
~~~~~~~~~~~

`Projections` between Mechanisms in the `pathway` of a Process are specified in one of three ways:

* Inline specification
    Projection specifications can be interposed between any two Mechanisms in the `pathway` list.  This creates a
    Projection from the preceding Mechanism in the list to the one that follows it.  The Projection specification can
    be an instance of a `MappingProjection`, the class name "MappingProjection", a
    `matrix keyword <Matrix_Keywords>` for a type of MappingProjection, or a dictionary with
    `specifications for the Projection <Projection_Creation>`.

* Stand-alone Projection
    When a Projection is created on its own, it can be assigned a `sender <MappingProjection_Sender>`
    and/or a `receiver <MappingProjection_Receiver>` Mechanism. If both are in the Process, then that
    Projection will be used when creating the Process.  Stand-alone specification of a Projection between two
    Mechanisms in a Process takes precedence over default or inline specification; that is, the stand-alone
    Projection will be used in place of any that is specified in the `pathway`. Stand-alone specification is required
    to implement projections between Mechanisms that are not adjacent to one another in the `pathway` list.

* Default assignment
    For any Mechanism that does not receive a Projection from another Mechanism in the Process (specified using one of
    the methods above), a `MappingProjection` is automatically created from the Mechanism that precedes it in the
    `pathway`.  If the format of the preceding Mechanism's output matches that of the next Mechanism, then an
    `IDENTITY_MATRIX` is used for the Projection;  if the formats do not match, or
    `learning has been specified <Process_Learning>` either for the Projection or the Process,
    then a `FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` is used. If the Mechanism is the `ORIGIN` Mechanism (i.e., first in the
    `pathway`), a `ProcessInputState <Process_Input_And_Output>` will be used as the sender,
    and an `IDENTITY_MATRIX` is used for the Projection.


.. _Process_Input_And_Ouput:

Process input and output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input to a Process is a list or 2d np.array provided as an argument in its `execute <Process_Base.execute>`
or `run <Process_Base.run>` methods, and assigned to its `input <Process_Base.input>` attribute. When a Process is
created, a set of `ProcessInputStates <process_input_states>` and `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` are
automatically created to transmit the Process' input to its `ORIGIN` Mechanism, as follows:

* if the number of items in the **input** is the same as the number of `ORIGIN` InputStates:
    a MappingProjection is created for each value of the input to an `InputState` of the `ORIGIN` Mechanism;

* if the **input** has only one item but the `ORIGIN` Mechanism has more than one InputState:
    a single ProcessInputState is created with Projections to each of the `ORIGIN` Mechanism InputStates;

* if the **input** has more than one item but the `ORIGIN` Mechanism has only one InputState:
    a ProcessInputState is created for each input item, and all project to the `ORIGIN` Mechanism's InputState;

* otherwise, if the **input** has more than one item and the `ORIGIN` Mechanism has more than one InputState,
  but the numbers are not equal, an error message is generated indicating that the there is an ambiguous mapping from
  the Process' **input** value to `ORIGIN` Mechanism's InputStates.

The output of a Process is a 2d np.array containing the values of its `TERMINAL` Mechanism's OutputStates.

.. _Process_Learning:

Learning
~~~~~~~~

Learning modifies Projections between Mechanisms in a Process's `pathway`, so that the input to each Projection's
`sender <MappingProjection_Sender>` produces the desired ("target") output from its
`receiver <MappingProjection_Receiver>`.  Learning occurs when a Projection or Process for which learning has been
specified is executed.  Learning can be specified for a particular Projection in a Process, or for the entire Process.
It is specified for a particular Projection by including a `learning specification <LearningSignal_Specification>`
in the specification for the Projection.  It is specified for the entire Process by assigning either a
`LearningProjection <LearningProjection_Creation>` or `LearningSignal <LearningSignal_Specification>` specification,
or the keyword *ENABLED* to the **learning** argument of the Process' constructor.  Specifying learning for a Process
implements it for all eligible Projections in the Process (i.e., all `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`,
excluding Projections from the Process' InputState to its `ORIGIN` Mechanism, and projections from the `TERMINAL`
Mechanism to the Process' OutputState). When learning is specified for the Process, all Projections in the Process
are trained so that input to the Process (i.e., its `ORIGIN` Mechanism) will generate the specified target value
as its output (i.e., the output of the `TERMINAL` Mechanism). In either case, all Mechanisms that receive Projections
for which learning has been specified must be `compatible with learning <LearningProjection>`).

When learning is specified, the following Components are automatically created for each Projection involved (
see figure below):
    * a `ComparatorMechanism` used to evaluate the output of the Projection's `receiver <MappingProjection_Receiver>`          against a target value;
    ..
    * a `MappingProjection` from the Projection's `receiver <MappingProjection_Receiver>` to the ComparatorMechanism;
    ..
    * a `LearningMechanism` that uses the error signal calculated by the ComparatorMechanism to generate a
      matrix of weight changes (`learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>`) to be applied to the
      Projection being learned;
    ..
    * a `MappingProjection` from the ComparatorMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputState to LearningMechanism's
      *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputState;
    ..
    * a `LearningProjection` from the LearningMechanism's `LearningSignal` OutputState to the Projection being learned.

Different learning algorithms can be specified (e.g., `Reinforcement` or `BackPropagation`), that implement the
Mechanisms and LearningSignals required for the specified type of learning. However,  as noted above,
all Mechanisms that receive Projections being learned must be compatible with learning.

When a Process or any of its Projections is specified for learning, a set of `target values <Run_Targets>`
must be provided (along with the **inputs**) in the **targets** argument to the Process' `execute
<Process_Base.execute>` or `run <Process_Base.run>` method.

   each layer.

.. _Process_Execution:

Execution
---------

A Process can be executed as part of a `System <System>` or on its own.  On its own, it is executed by calling
either its `execute <Process_Base.execute>` or `run <Process_Base.run>` method.  `execute <Process.execute>`
executes the Process once (that is, it executes a single `TRIAL`);  `run <Process.run>` allows a series of
`TRIAL` \s to be executed. When a Process is executed, its `input` is conveyed to the `ORIGIN` Mechanism (first
Mechanism in the pathway).  By default, the the input is presented only once.  If the `ORIGIN` Mechanism is
executed again in the same `PASS` of execution (e.g., if it appears again in the pathway, or receives recurrent
projections), the input is not presented again. However, the input can be "clamped" on using the **clamp_input**
argument of `execute <Process_Base.execute>` or `run <Process_Base.run>`.  After the `ORIGIN` Mechanism is executed,
each subsequent Mechanism in the `pathway` is executed in sequence.  If a Mechanism is specified in the pathway in a
`MechanismTuple <Process_Mechanism_Specification>`, then the runtime parameters are applied and the Mechanism is
executed using them (see `Mechanism` for parameter specification).  Finally the output of the `TERMINAL` Mechanism
(last one in the pathway) is assigned as the output of the Process.

.. note::
   Processes do not use a `Scheduler`; each Mechanism is executed once, in the order listed in the `pathway`.
   To more precisely control the order of and/or any dependencies in the sequence of executions, the Process
   should be used to construct as `System`, together with `Conditions <Conditions>` to implement a custom schedule.

If `learning <Process_Learning>` has been specified for the Process or any of the projections in its `pathway`,
then the relevant `LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanism>` are executed. These calculate changes that will be made to
the corresponding Projections.

.. note::
   The changes to a Projection induced by learning are not applied until the Mechanisms that receive those
   projections are next executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

Examples
--------

*Specification of Mechanisms in a pathway:*  The first Mechanism is specified as a reference to an instance,
the second as a default instance of a Mechanism type, and the third in MechanismTuple format (specifying a reference
to a Mechanism that should receive some_params at runtime::

    mechanism_1 = TransferMechanism()
    mechanism_2 = DDM()
    some_params = {PARAMETER_STATE_PARAMS:{THRESHOLD:2,NOISE:0.1}}
    my_process = process(pathway=[mechanism_1, TransferMechanism, (mechanism_2, some_params)])

*Default Projection specification:*  The `pathway` for this Process uses default Projection specifications; as a
result, a `MappingProjection` is automatically instantiated between each of the Mechanisms listed::

    my_process = process(pathway=[mechanism_1, mechanism_2, mechanism_3])


*Inline Projection specification using an existing Projection:*  In this `pathway`, ``projection_A`` is specified as
the Projection between the first and second Mechanisms; a default Projection will be created between ``mechanism_2``
and ``mechanism_3``::

    projection_A = MappingProjection()
    my_process = process(pathway=[mechanism_1, projection_A, mechanism_2, mechanism_3])

*Inline Projection specification using a keyword:*  In this `pathway`, a `RANDOM_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX`
is assigned as the Projection between the first and second Mechanisms::

    my_process = process(pathway=[mechanism_1, RANDOM_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX, mechanism_2, mechanism_3])

*Stand-alone Projection specification:*  In this `pathway`, ``projection_A`` is explicilty specified as a Projection
between ``mechanism_1`` and ``mechanism_2``, and so will be used as the Projection between them in ``my_process``;
a default Projection will be created between ``mechanism_2`` and ``mechanism_3``::

    projection_A = MappingProjection(sender=mechanism_1, receiver=mechanism_2)
    my_process = process(pathway=[mechanism_1, mechanism_2, mechanism_3])

*Process that implements learning:*  This `pathway` implements a series of Mechanisms with Projections between them,
all of which will be learned using `BackPropagation` (the default learning algorithm).  Note that it uses the `Logistic`
function, which is compatible with BackPropagation::

    mechanism_1 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    mechanism_2 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    mechanism_3 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)

.. XXX USE EXAMPLE BELOW THAT CORRESPONDS TO CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY (WHETHER TARGET MUST BE SPECIFIED)
    # my_process = process(pathway=[mechanism_1, mechanism_2, mechanism_3],
    #                      learning=ENABLED)
    my_process = process(pathway=[mechanism_1, mechanism_2, mechanism_3],
                         learning=ENABLED,
                         target=[0])

.. ADD EXAMPLE HERE WHEN FUNCTIONALITY IS AVAILABLE
   *Process with individual Projections that implement learning:*

    mechanism_1 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    mechanism_2 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    mechanism_3 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    # my_process = process(pathway=[mechanism_1, mechanism_2, mechanism_3],
    #                      learning=ENABLED)

    Arguments
    ---------

    process_spec : Optional[str or Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        specification for the Process to create.
        If it is `None`, returns an instance of Process with a single :ref:`DefaultMechanism <LINK>`;
        if it is a string, uses it as the name for the Process;
        if it is a dict, the key for each entry must be a parameter name, and its value the value to assign to that
        parameter (these will be used to instantiate the Process, and will override any values assigned
        to the arguments in the call to :py:func:`process`). If a name is not specified, the nth instance created
        will be named by using the Process' `componentType <Process_Base.componentType>` attribute as the base and
        adding an indexed suffix: componentType-n.

    default_variable : List[values] or ndarray :  default default input value of ORIGIN Mechanism
        the input to the Process used if none is provided in a call to the `execute <Process_Base.execute>` or `run
        <Process_Base.run>` method. This must be the same length as the `ORIGIN` Mechanism's input.

    pathway : List[Mechanism spec[, Projection spec], Mechanism spec...] : default List[DefaultMechanism]
        the set of Mechanisms and projections between them to execute when the Process is executed.  Each Mechanism
        must a `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>`.  The specification for each can be an instance,
        a class name (creates a default instance), or a `specification dictionary <Mechanism_Creation>`.  Each
        Projection must be a `MappingProjection`. The specification for each can be the class name (creates a
        default instance), an instance, or a `specification dictionary <Projection_Creation>`.

    initial_values : Optional[Dict[Mechanism, param value]] : default None
        a dictionary of values used to initialize the specified Mechanisms. The key for each entry must be a Mechanism
        object, and the value must be a number, list or np.array that must be compatible with the format of
        the Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` attribute. Mechanisms not specified will be initialized
        with their `default_variable <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.default_variable>`.

    clamp_input : Optional[keyword] : default None
        specifies whether the input to the Process continues to be applied to the `ORIGIN` Mechanism after
        its initial execution.  The following keywords can be used:

            * `None`: Process input is used only for the first execution of the `ORIGIN` Mechanism
              in a `PASS` of executions.

            * SOFT_CLAMP: combines the Process' input with input from any other projections to the
              `ORIGIN` Mechanism every time it is executed in a `PASS` of executions.

            * HARD_CLAMP: applies the Process' input in place of any other sources of input to the
              `ORIGIN` Mechanism every time it is executed in a `PASS` of executions.

    default_projection_matrix : keyword, list or ndarray : default DEFAULT_PROJECTION_MATRIX,
        the type of matrix used for default projections (see `matrix` parameter for `MappingProjection`).

    learning : Optional[LearningProjection spec]
        implements `learning <LearningProjection_CreationLearningSignal>` for all eligible projections in the Process.

    learning_rate : float : None
        set the learning rate for all Mechanisms in the Process (see `learning_rate` attribute for additional
        information).

    target : List or ndarray : default ndarray of zeroes
        the value assigned as the TARGET input for the `ObjectiveMechanism` to which the `TERMINAL` Mechanism of the
        Process projects (and assigned as its `TARGET` Mechanism; used for `learning <Process_Learning>`).
        It must be the same length as the `TERMINAL` Mechanism's output.

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can include any of the parameters above;
        the parameter's name is used as the keyword for its entry. Values specified for parameters in the dictionary
        override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default Process-<index>
        a string used for the name of the Process
        (see Registry module for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names)

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Process.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for Process (see ComponentPreferenceSet module for specification of PreferenceSet)

    Base class for Process.

    .. note::
       Process is an abstract class and should NEVER be instantiated by a direct call to its constructor.
       It should be instantiated using the :class:`process` factory method (see it for description of parameters).

    COMMENT:
        Description
        -----------
            Process is a Category of the Component class.
            It implements a Process that is used to execute a sequence of Mechanisms connected by projections.
            NOTES:
                * if no pathway or time_scale is provided:
                    a single Mechanism of Mechanism class default_mechanism and TRIAL are used
                * Process.input is set to the InputState.value of the first Mechanism in the pathway
                * Process.output is set to the OutputState.value of the last Mechanism in the pathway

        Class methods
        -------------
            - execute(input, control_signal_allocations, time_scale):
                executes the Process by calling execute_functions of the Mechanisms (in order) in the pathway list
                assigns input to sender.output (and passed through mapping) of first Mechanism in the pathway list
                assigns output of last Mechanism in the pathway list to self.output
                returns output after either one time_step or the full trial (determined by time_scale)
            - register_process(): registers Process with ProcessRegistry
            [TBI: - adjust(control_signal_allocations=NotImplemented):
                modifies the control_signal_allocations while the Process is executing;
                calling it without control_signal_allocations functions like interrogate
                returns (responseState, accuracy)
            [TBI: - interrogate(): returns (responseState, accuracy)
            [TBI: - terminate(): terminates the Process and returns output
            [TBI: - accuracy(target):
                a function that uses target together with the pathway's output.value(s)
                and its accuracyFunction to return an accuracy measure;
                the target must be in a pathway-appropriate format (checked with call)

        ProcessRegistry
        ---------------
            All Processes are registered in ProcessRegistry, which maintains a dict for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances
    COMMENT

    Attributes
    ----------

    componentType : "Process"

    pathway : List[(Mechanism, dict, int), (Projection, LearningProjection spec, None), (Mechanism, dict, int)...]
        specifies the list of Mechanisms that are executed (in the order specified) when the Process executes.
        Entries are alternating tuples specifying Mechanisms and projections.  For Mechanism tuples, the dict specifies
        a set of `runtime parameters <Mechanism_Runtime_Parameters>` to use for execution of the Mechanism. For
        Projection tuples, the LearningProjection specification can be a `LearningProjection` object, the class or the
        `LEARNING_PROJECTION` keyword (which specifies a default instance) or the constructor for a LearningProjection
        (including parameters).

        .. note::
             The value of this attribute is constructed from the `pathway` argument of the :py:func:`process`
             function, the entries of which do not necessarily have to have all items in a tuple, or even be in tuple
             form.  All entries of the `pathway` argument are converted to tuples when assigned to the `pathway`
             attribute.  Entries that are not tuples must be a Mechanism or Projection.  For tuple entries,
             the first item must be a Mechanism or Projection;  the second is optional, and `None` is entered for
             missing values; the third item is optional for Mechanism tuples (0 is the default) and is currently
             ignored for Projection tuples (and assigned `None`, as it is not currently in use).

    process_input_states : Optional[List[ProcessInputState]]
        used to represent the input to the Process, and transmit this to the InputState(s) of its `ORIGIN`
        Mechanism.  Each ProcessInputState sends a MappingProjection to one or more InputStates of the
        `ORIGIN` Mechanism.

    input :  Optional[List[value] or ndarray]
        input to the Process for each `TRIAL` of executions;  it is assigned the value of the :keyword:`input` argument
        in a call to the Process' `execute <Process_Base.execute>`  or `run <Process_Base.run>` method. Its items are
        assigned as the value of the corresponding ProcessInputStates in `process_input_states`, and must match the
        format of the `variable <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.variable>` for the Process' `ORIGIN` Mechanism.

        .. note:: The :keyword:`input` attribute of a Process preserves its value throughout the execution of the
                  Process. It's value is assigned to the `variable <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute of
                  the `ORIGIN` Mechanism at the start of execution.  After that, by default, that Mechanism's
                  :keyword:`variable` attribute is zeroed. This is so that if the `ORIGIN` Mechanism is executed
                  again in the same `PASS` of executions (e.g., if it is part of a recurrent loop) it does not continue
                  to receive the initial input to the Process.  However, this behavior can be modified with the Process'
                  `clamp_input` attribute.

    input_value :  2d np.array : default ``variableInstanceDefault``
        same as the :keyword:`variable` attribute of the Process; contains the values of the ProcessInputStates in its
        `process_input_states` attribute.

    clamp_input : Optional[keyword]
        determines whether the Process' input continues to be applied to the `ORIGIN` Mechanism if it is executed again
        within the same `TRIAL`.  It can take the following values:

        * `None`: applies the Process' `input` to the `ORIGIN` Mechanism only once (the first time it is executed)
          in a given round of the Process' execution.

        * `SOFT_CLAMP`: combines the Process' `input` with input from any other projections to the
          `ORIGIN` Mechanism every time the latter is executed within a round of the Process' execution.

        * `HARD_CLAMP`: applies the Process' `input` to the `ORIGIN` Mechanism in place of any other sources of input
          every time it is executed.

    initial_values : Optional[Dict[Mechanism, param value]]
        a dictionary of values used to initialize the specified Mechanisms. The key for each entry is a Mechanism
        object, and the value is a number, list or np.array that must be compatible with the format of
        the Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` attribute. Mechanisms not specified will be
        initialized with their `default_variable <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.default_variable>`.

    value: 2d. np.array
        the value of the `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` of the `TERMINAL` Mechanism of the Process.

    outputState : State
        the `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` of the `TERMINAL` Mechanism in the Process.

      .. _mechs : List[MechanismTuple]
             :class:`MechanismTuple` for all Mechanisms in the Process, listed in the order specified in pathway.
             MechanismTuples are of the form: (Mechanism, runtime_params, phase) where runtime_params is dictionary
             of {argument keyword: argument values} entries and phase is an int.
             Note:  the list includes ComparatorMechanisms and LearningMechanisms.

      .. _allMechanisms : MechanismList
             Contains all Mechanisms in the System (based on _mechs).

      .. _origin_mechs : List[MechanismTuple]
             Contains a tuple for the `ORIGIN` Mechanism of the Process.
             (Note:  the use of a list is for compatibility with the MechanismList object)

      .. _terminal_mechs : List[MechanismTuple]
             Contains a tuple for the `TERMINAL` Mechanism of the Process.
             (Note:  the use of a list is for compatibility with the MechanismList object)

      .. _target_mechs : List[MechanismTuple]
             Contains a tuple for the `TARGET` Mechanism of the Process.
             (Note:  the use of a list is for compatibility with the MechanismList object)

      .. _learning_mechs : List[MechanismTuple]
             `MechanismTuples <Mechanism.MechanismTuples>` for all `LearningMechanism <LearningMechanisms>` in the
             Process (used for learning).

      .. mechanisms : List[Mechanism]
             List of all Mechanisms in the Process.
             property that points to _allMechanisms.mechanisms (see below).

    mechanismNames : List[str]
        the names of the Mechanisms in the Process.

        .. property that points to _allMechanisms.names (see below).

    mechanisms : List[Mechanism]
        a list of the Mechanisms in the Process.

    origin_mechanisms : MechanismList
        a list with the `ORIGIN` Mechanism of the Process.

        .. note:: A Process can have only one `ORIGIN` Mechanism; the use of a list is for compatibility with
                  methods that are also used for Systems.

        COMMENT:
            based on _origin_mechs;  Process.input contains the input to `ORIGIN` Mechanism.
        COMMENT

    terminalMechanisms : MechanismList
        a list with the `TERMINAL` Mechanism of the Process.

        .. note:: A Process can have only one `TERMINAL` Mechanism; the use of a list is for compatibility with
                  methods that are also used for Systems.

    learning_mechanisms : MechanismList
        a list of all of the `LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanisms>` in the Process.

        .. based on _learning_mechs

    target_mechanisms : MechanismList
        a list with the `TARGET` Mechanism (`ComparatorMechanism`) of the Process.

        .. note:: A Process can have only one `TARGET` Mechanism; the use of a list is for compatibility with
                  methods that are also used for Systems.

        COMMENT:
            based on _target_mechs
        COMMENT

    systems : List[System]
        a list of the Systems to which the Process belongs.

      .. _phaseSpecMax : int : default 0
             phase of last (set of) ProcessingMechanism(s) to be executed in the Process.
             It is assigned to the ``phaseSpec`` for the Mechanism in the pathway with the largest ``phaseSpec`` value.

      .. numPhases : int : default 1
            the number of :ref:`phases <System_Execution_Phase>` for the Process.

        COMMENT:
            It is assigned as ``_phaseSpecMax + 1``.
        COMMENT

      .. _isControllerProcess : bool : :keyword:`False`
             identifies whether the Process is an internal one created by a ControlMechanism.

    learning : Optional[LearningProjection]
        determines whether the Process is configured for learning.  The value can be a `LearningProjection`,
        the keyword `LEARNING_PROJECTION`, the name of the class, or a call to its constructor.

        .. note::  If an existing `LearningProjection` or a call to the constructor is used for the specification,
                   the object itself will **not** be used as the LearningProjection for the Process. Rather it
                   will be used as a template (including any parameters that are specified) for creating
                   LearningProjections for all of the `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` in the Process.

                   .. _learning_enabled : bool
                      indicates whether or not learning is enabled.  This only has effect if the ``learning`` parameter
                      has been specified (see above).

    learning_rate : float : default None
        determines the learning rate for all Mechanisms in the Process.  This overrides any values set for the
        function of individual LearningProjections, and persists for all subsequent runs of the System.  If it is
        set to None, then the learning_rate is determined by the last value assigned to each LearningProjection
        (either directly, or following a run of any Process or System to which the LearningProjection belongs and
        for which a learning_rate was set).

    results : List[OutputState.value]
        a list of return values from a sequence of executions of the Process.

    timeScale : TimeScale : default TimeScale.TRIAL
        determines the default `TimeScale` value used by Mechanisms in the pathway.

    name : str : default Process-<index>
        the name of the Process.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the Process;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by ProcessRegistry
        (see :ref:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Process.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for the Process.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the Process;  if it is not specified, a default is
        assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :ref:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).

            enables or disables learning during execution.
            If it is not specified, current state is left intact.
            If `True`, learning is forced on; if :keyword:`False`, learning is forced off.

        call_before_trial : Function : default None
            called before each trial in the sequence is executed.

        call_after_trial : Function : default None
            called after each trial in the sequence is executed.

        call_before_time_step : Function : default None
            called before each time_step of each trial is executed.
