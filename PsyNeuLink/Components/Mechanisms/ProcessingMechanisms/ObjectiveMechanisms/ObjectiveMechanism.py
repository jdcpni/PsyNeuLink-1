Overview
--------

An ObjectiveMechanism is a `ProcessingMechanism` that monitors the `OutputStates <OutputState>` of one or more other
ProcessingMechanisms specified in its `monitor <ObjectiveMechanism.monitor>` attribute, and evaluates them using its
`function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`. The result of the evaluation is placed in the ObjectiveMechanism's
`primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`.  ObjectiveMechanisms are typically used closely with (and often created
automatically by) `AdaptiveMechanisms <AdaptiveMechanism>`.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Creation:

Creating an ObjectiveMechanism
------------------------------

ObjectiveMechanisms are often created automatically when other PsyNeuLink components are created (in particular,
AdaptiveMechanisms such as `LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanism_Creation>` and
`ControlMechanisms <ControlMechanism_Creation>`.  An ObjectiveMechanism can also be created directly by calling its
constructor.  Its **monitored_values** argument is used to specify the OutputStates to be monitored.  Any of the forms
used for `specifying OutputStates <OutputState_Specification>` can be used, as well as a value of
MonitoredOutputStateOption.  When an ObjectiveMechanism is created, an InputState is created for each of the
OutputStates specified in its **monitored_values** argument, and a `MappingProjection` is assigned from each of those
to the corresponding InputState.  By default, the value of each InputState uses the format of its corresponding
OutputState, and the MappingProjection between them uses an `IDENTITY_MATRIX`.  However, the **input_states** argument
can be used to customize the InputStates, and/or to specify their names. Any of the forms used for
`specifying InputStates <InputState_Specification>` can be used in the **input_states** argument, however the number
of InputStates specified must equal the number of OutputStates specified in the **monitored_values** argument (see the
`examples <ObjectiveMechanism_Examples>` below). The value of each must also be of the same type as the value of the
corresponding OutputState, however their lengths can differ;  in that case, by default, the MappingProjection created
uses a  `FULL_CONNECTIVITY` matrix, although this too can be customized using the *PROJECTION* entry of a
`State specification dictionary <State_Specification>` for the InputState in the **input_states** argument.


.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

An ObjectiveMechanism has one `InputState <InputState>` for each of the OutputStates specified in its
**monitored_values** argument, each pair of which is connected by a `MappingProjection`.  The monitored OutputStates
are listed in the ObjectiveMechanism's `monitored_values <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_values>` attribute, and
the InputStates to which they project are listed in the ObjectiveMechanism's
`input_states <ObjectiveMechanism.input_states>` attribute.  The ObjectiveMechanism's
`function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` uses these values to compute an
`objective (or "loss") function <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function>`_, that is assigned as the value of its
*ERROR_SIGNAL* (`primary <OutputState_Primary>`) OutputState.  By default, it uses a `LinearCombination` function to
sum the values of its InputStates.  However, the `function <ComparatorMechanism.function>` can be customized to
calculate other quantities (differences, ratios, etc. -- see
`example <ObjectiveMechanism_Weights_and_Exponents_Example>` below). It can also be replaced with any Python function
or method, so long as it takes a 2d array as its input, and generates a 1d array as its result.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Monitored_Values:

Monitored Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These can be specified in a variety of ways, each of which must eventually resolve to an OutputState, the
value of which is to be monitored.

Note that some forms of
specification may depend on specifications made for the OutputState referenced, the Mechanism to which it belongs,
and/or the Process or System to which that Mechanism belongs. These interactions (and the precedence afforded to
each) are described below.

If an OutputState is specified at the time the ObjectiveMechanism is created, or the specification can be resolved
to an OutputState, a MappingProjection is automatically created from it to the corresponding InputState
using `AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX` as its `matrix <MapppingProjection.matrix>` parameter.  If the OutputState can't be
determined, no MappingProjection is assigned, and this must be done by some other means;  any values in
`monitored_values` that are not associated with an OutputState at the time the ObjectiveMechanism is executed are
ignored.

The specification of item in `monitored_values` can take any of the following forms:

* **OutputState**:  a reference to the `OutputState <OutputState>` of a Mechanism.  This will create a
  `MappingProjection` from it to the corresponding InputState in `input_states <ObjectiveMechanism.input_states>`.
COMMENT: TBI
    Note that an outputState can be *excluded* from being monitored by assigning `None` as the value of its
    `monitoring_status` attribute.  This specification takes precedence over any others;  that is, it will suppress
    monitoring of that outputState, irrespective of any other specifications that might otherwise apply to that
    outputState, including those described below.
COMMENT
..
* **Mechanism**: by default, the Mechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` will be used.  However,
  if the Mechanism has any OutputStates specified in its `monitored_states` attribute, those will be used (except for
  any that specify `None` as their `monitoring_status`). This specification takes precedence over any of the other
  types listed below:  if it is `None`, then none of that Mechanism's OutputStates will be monitored; if it
  specifies OutputStates to be monitored, those will be monitored even if they do not satisfy any of the conditions
  described in the specifications below.
..

COMMENT: TBI
    .. _ObjectiveMechanism_OutputState_Tuple:

    * **MonitoredOutputState Tuple**  tuple can be used wherever an OutputState can be specified, to determine how
      its value is combined with others by the ObjectiveMechanism's `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`. Each
      tuple must have the three following items in the order listed:

          * an OutputState or Mechanism, the name of one, or a specification dictionary for one;
          ..
          * a weight (int) - multiplies the value of the OutputState.
          ..
          * an exponent (int) - exponentiates the value of the OutputState;
COMMENT

* **string**, **value** or **dict**: These can be used as placemarkers for a monitored_state that will be instantiated
  later (for example, for the TARGET input of a Composition).  If a string is specified, it is used as the
  default name of the corresponding InputState (specified in the `input_states <ObjectiveMechanism.input_states>`
  attribute of the ObjectiveMechanism) If a value is specified, it is used as the default value for the corresponding
  InputState.  If a dict is specified, it must have a single entry, the key of which will be used as a string
  specification -- i.e., as the name of the InputState -- and the value as its value specification.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Function:

Function
~~~~~~~~

The ObjectiveMechanism's `function` can be customized to implement a wide variety of
`objective (or "loss") functions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function>`_.  The default is the
`LinearCombination` function, which simply sums the values of the OutputStates listed in `monitored_values`.
However, this can easily be configured to calculate differences, ratios, etc. (see
`example <ObjectiveMechanism_Weights_and_Exponents_Example>` below).  It can also be replaced with any
`CombinationFunction`, or any python function that takes a 2d array with an arbitrary number of
items or a number equal to the number of items in the ObjectiveMechanism's variable (and its number of
input_states), and returns a 1d array.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

When an ObjectiveMechanism is executed, it updates its input_states with the values of the OutputStates listed in
its `monitored_values` attribute, and then uses its `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` to
evaluate these.  The result is assigned as to its `value <ObjectiveMechanism.value>` attribute as the value of its
`primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`.


.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Examples:

Examples
--------

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Default_Input_Value_Example:

*Formatting InputState values*

The use of default_variable to override a specification in `monitored_values` can be useful in some situations.
For example, for `Reinforcement Learning <Reinforcement>`, an ObjectiveMechanism is used to monitor an action
selection Mechanism.  In the example below, the latter uses a `TransferMechanism` with the `SoftMax` function (and the
`PROB <Softmax.PROB>` as its output format) to select the action.  This generates a vector with a single non-zero
value, which designates the predicted reward for the selected action.  Because the output is a vector,
by default the InputState of the ObjectiveMechanism created to monitor it will also be a vector.  However, the
ObjectiveMechanism requires that this be a single value, that it can compare with the value of the reward Mechanism.
This can be dealt with by using `default_variable` in the constructor of the ObjectiveMechanism, to force
the InputState for the ObjectiveMechanism to have a single value, as in the example below::

    my_action_select_mech = TransferMechanism(default_variable = [0,0,0],
                                function=SoftMax(output=PROB))

    my_reward_mech = TransferMechanism(default_variable = [0])

    my_objective_mech = ObjectiveMechanism(monitored_values = [my_action_select_mech, my_reward_mech])

Note that the OutputState for the `my_action_selection` and `my_reward_mech` are specified
in `monitored_values`.  If that were the only specification, the InputState created for `my_action_select_mech`
would be a vector of length 3.  This is overridden by specifying `default_variable` as an array with two
single-value arrays (one corresponding to `my_action_select_mech` and the other to `my_reward_mech`).  This forces
the InputState for `my_action_select_mech` to have only a single element which, in turn, will cause a
MappingProjection to be created from  `my_action_select_mech` to the ObjectiveMechanism's InputState using a
`FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` (the one used for `AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX` when the sender and receiver have values of
different lengths).  This produces the desired effect, since the action selected is the only non-zero value in the
output of `my_action_select_mech`, and so the `FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` will combine it with zeros (the other values
in the vector), and so its value will be assigned as the value of the corresponding InputState in the
ObjectiveMechanism.  Another option would have been to customize the ObjectiveMechanism's
`function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` to convert the output of `my_action_select_mech` to a length 1 vector, though
this would have been more involved.  The next example describes a simple case of customizing the ObjectiveMechanism's
`function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`, however more sophisticated ones are possible, just as the one just suggested.

.. _ObjectiveMechanism_Weights_and_Exponents_Example:

*Customizing the ObjectiveMechanism's function*

The simplest way to customize the `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` of an ObjectiveMechanism is to
parameterize its default function (`LinearCombination`).  In the example below, the ObjectiveMechanism used in the
`previous example <ObjectiveMechanism_Default_Input_Value_Example>` is further customized to subtract the value
of the action selected from the value of the reward::

    my_objective_mech = ObjectiveMechanism(default_variable = [[0],[0]],
                                          monitored_values = [my_action_select_mech, my_reward_mech],
                                          function=LinearCombination(weights=[[-1], [1]]))

This is done by specifying the `weights <LinearCombination.weights>` parameter of the `LinearCombination` function,
with two values [-1] and [1] corresponding to the two items in `monitored_values` (and `default_variable`).  This
will multiply the value from `my_action_select_mech` by -1 before adding it to (and thus
subtracting it from) the value of `my_reward_mech`.  Similarly, the `operation <LinearCombination.operation>`
and `exponents <LinearCombination.exponents>` parameters of `LinearCombination` can be used together to multiply and
divide quantities.
