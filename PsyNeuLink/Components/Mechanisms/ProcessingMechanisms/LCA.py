Overview
--------

An LCA is a subclass of `RecurrentTransferMechanism` that implements a single-layered leaky competitive accumulator
network, in which each element is connected to every other element with mutually inhibitory weights.  All of the
inhibitory weights have the same value, specified by its `inhibition <LCA.inhibition>` parameter.  In the case that
it has two elements, the value of its `inhibition <LCA.inhibition>` parameter is equal to its `decay
<RecurrentTransferMechanism.decay>` parameter, and the two are of sufficient magnitude, it implements a close
approximation of a `DDM` Mechanism
(see `Usher & McClelland, 2001; <http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.550>`_ and
`Bogacz et al (2006) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014301>`_).

.. _Recurrent_Transfer_Creation:

Creating an LCA
---------------

An LCA can be created directly by calling its constructor, or using the `mechanism() <Mechanism.mechanism>` function
and specifying LCA as its **mech_spec** argument.  The set of mutually inhibitory connections are implemented as a
recurrent `MappingProjection` with a `matrix <LCA.matrix>` of uniform negative weights specified by
the **inhibition** argument of the LCA's constructor.  The default format of its `variable <LCA.variable>`, and default
values of its `inhibition <LCA.inhibition>`, `decay <RecurrentTransferMechanism.decay>` and
`noise <TransferMechanism.noise>` parameters implement an approximation of a `DDM`.

.. _LCA_Structure:

Structure
---------

The distinguishing feature of an LCA is its `matrix <LCA.matrix>` of uniform negative weights.  It also has, in
addition to its `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` (which contains the current value of the elements of the
LCA) and the OutputStates of a RecurrentTransferMechanism, it has two additional OutputStates: `MAX_VS_NEXT <LCA.LCA_OUTPUT.MAX_VS_NEXT>` and
`MAX_VS_AVG <MAX_VS_AVG>`.  Both are two element arrays that track the element of the LCA with the currently highest value relative
to the value of the others.  The two elements of the `MAX_VS_NEXT` OutputState contain, respectively, the index of the
LCA element with the greatest value, and the difference between its value and the next highest one;  `MAX_VS_AVG`
contains the index of the LCA element with the greatest value, and the difference between its value and the average
of all the others.  For an LCA with only two elements, `MAX_VS_NEXT` implements a close approximation of the
`threshold <DDM.threshold>` parameter of a `DDM`
(see `Usher & McClelland, 2001; <http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.550>`_ and
`Bogacz et al (2006) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17014301>`_).
For an LCA with more than two elements, `MAX_VS_NEXT` and
`MAX_VS_AVERAGE` implement threshold approximations with different properties
(see `McMillen & Holmes, 2006 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249605000891>`_).

.. _LCA_Execution:

Execution
---------

The execution of an LCA is identical to that of `RecurrentTransferMechanism`.

            LCA is a Subtype of the RecurrentTransferMechanism Subtype of the TransferMechanism
            Subtype of the ProcessingMechanisms Type of the Mechanism Category of the Component class.

    COMMENT

    Arguments
    ---------

    default_variable : number, list or np.ndarray : default Transfer_DEFAULT_BIAS
        specifies the input to the Mechanism to use if none is provided in a call to its
        `execute <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.execute>` or `run <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.run>` method;
        also serves as a template to specify the length of `variable <TransferMechanism.variable>` for
        `function <TransferMechanism.function>`, and the `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`
        of the Mechanism.

    size : int, list or np.ndarray of ints
        specifies variable as array(s) of zeros if **variable** is not passed as an argument;
        if **variable** is specified, it takes precedence over the specification of **size**.

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear
        specifies the function used to transform the input;  can be `Linear`, `Logistic`, `Exponential`,
        or a custom function.

    inhibition : number : default 1.0
        specifies the magnitude of the (uniform) negative weights used for the
        `matrix <LCA.matrix>` parameter of the `recurrent_projection <LCA.recurrent_projection>`.

    decay : number : default 1.0
        specifies the amount by which to decrement its `previous_input <TransferMechanism.previous_input>`
        in each execution of the Mechanism.

    initial_value :  value, list or np.ndarray : default Transfer_DEFAULT_BIAS
        specifies the starting value for time-averaged input (only relevant if
        `time_constant <TransferMechanism.time_constant>` is not 1.0).
        :py:data:`Transfer_DEFAULT_BIAS <LINK->SHOULD RESOLVE TO VALUE>`

    noise : float or function : default 0.0
        a stochastically-sampled value added to the result of the `function <TransferMechanism.function>`:
        if it is a float, it must be in the interval [0,1] and is used to scale the variance of a zero-mean Gaussian;
        if it is a function, it must return a scalar value.

    time_constant : float : default 1.0
        the time constant for exponential time averaging of input when the Mechanism is executed with `time_scale`
        set to `TimeScale.TIME_STEP`

        `result = (time_constant * current input) + (1-time_constant * result on previous time_step)`

    range : Optional[Tuple[float, float]]
        specifies the allowable range for the result of `function <TransferMechanism.function>`:
        the first item specifies the minimum allowable value of the result, and the second its maximum allowable value;
        any element of the result that exceeds the specified minimum or maximum value is set to the value of
        `range <TransferMechanism.range>` that it exceeds.

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the Mechanism, its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters.  Values specified for parameters in
        the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    time_scale :  TimeScale : TimeScale.TRIAL
        specifies whether the Mechanism is executed using the `TIME_STEP` or `TRIAL` `TimeScale`.
        This must be set to `TimeScale.TIME_STEP` for the `time_constant <TransferMechanism.time_constant>`
        parameter to have an effect.

    name : str : default TransferMechanism-<index>
        a string used for the name of the Mechanism.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by `MechanismRegistry`
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Mechanism.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for Mechanism.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py

        `inhibition <LCA.inhibition>` attribute.

    recurrent_projection : MappingProjection
        a `MappingProjection` that projects from the Mechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`
        back to it `primary inputState <Mechanism_InputStates>`.

    inhibition : number : default 1.0
        determines the magnitude of the (uniform) negative weights for the `matrix <LCA.matrix>` parameter
        of the `recurrent_projection <LCA.recurrent_projection>`.

    decay : float : default 1.0
        determines the amount by which to multiply the `previous_input <TransferMechanism.previous_input>` value
        in each execution of the Mechanism (acts, in effect like the weight on a self-connection).

        a stochastically-sampled value added to the output of the `function <TransferMechahnism.function>`:
        if it is a float, it must be in the interval [0,1] and is used to scale the variance of a zero-mean Gaussian;

        determines the allowable range of the result: the first value specifies the minimum allowable value
        and the second the maximum allowable value;  any element of the result that exceeds minimum or maximum
