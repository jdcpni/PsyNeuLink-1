"""
Overview
--------

A ControlMechanism is an `AdaptiveMechanism` that modifies the parameter(s) of one or more
`Components <Component>`. Its `function <ControlMechanism_Base.function>` takes an evaluative signal (usually the
output of an `ObjectiveMechanism`) and uses that to calculate an
`allocation_policy <ControlMechanism_Base.allocation_policy>`:  a list of `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>`
values for each of its `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>`.  This is used by each ControlSignal to calculate its
`intensity`, which is then conveyed by the ControlSignal's `ControlProjection(s) <ControlProjection>` to the
`ParameterState(s) <ParameterState>` to which they project.  Each ParameterState then uses the value received by a
ControlProjection to modify the value of the parameter for which it is responsible (see `ModulatorySignal_Modulation`
for a more detailed description of how modulation operates).  A ControlMechanism can regulate only the parameters of
Components in the System for which it is the `controller <System_Execution_Control>`.  The control Components of a
system can be displayed using the System's `show_graph` method with its **show_control** argument assigned as `True`.
COMMENT: TBI
The control components of a system can be displayed using the system's
`show_graph` method with its **show_control** argument assigned as :keyword:``True`.
COMMENT

The control components of a System are executed after all `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` and
`learning components <LearningMechanism>` in that system have been executed (see `System Execution <System_Execution>`).

.. _ControlMechanism_Creation:

Creating A ControlMechanism
---------------------------

A ControlMechanism can be created using the standard Python method of calling the constructor for the desired type.
A ControlMechanism is also created automatically whenever a `System is created <System_Creation>`, and it is assigned as
the `controller <System_Execution_Control>` for that System. The values to be monitored by the ControlMechanism are
specified in the **monitor_for_control** argument of its constructor, and the parameters it controls are specified in
the **control_signals** argument.  When the ControlMechanism is created, it automatically creates
an ObjectiveMechanism (used to monitor and evaluate the values specified in **monitor_for_control**)
as well as `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>` and `ControlProjections <ControlProjection>` used to control the parameters
specified in **control_signals**, as described below. The kind of ObjectiveMechanism created by a ControlMechanism,
and how it evaluates the values it monitors, depends on the :ref:`subclass <LINK>` of ControlMechanism.

.. _ControlMechanism_Control_Signals:

Specifying Parameters to Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ControlMechanisms are used to control the parameter values of other `Components <Component>` (including
`Functions <Function>`).  A parameter can be specified for control by assigning it a `ControlProjection`
or `ControlSignal` (along with the parameter's value) wherever a parameter can be specified (see
`ParameterState_Specification`).  The parameters to be controlled by a ControlMechanism can also be specified in the
**control_signals**  argument of the constructor for a ControlMechanism.  The **control_signals** argument must be a
list, each item of which can use any of the forms used for `specifying a ControlSignal <ControlSignal_Specification>`.

A `ControlSignal` is created for each item listed in the **control_signals** argument of its constructor, and all of
the ControlSignals for a ControlMechanism are listed in its `control_signals <ControlMechanism_Base.control_signals>`
attribute.  Each ControlSignal is assigned a `ControlProjection` to the `ParameterState` associated with each parameter
it controls. ControlSignals are a type of `OutputState`, and so they are also listed in the ControlMechanism's
`output_states <Mechanism_Base.output_states>` attribute.

.. _ControlMechanism_Monitored_Values:

Specifying Values to Monitor for Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a ControlMechanism is created, it automatically creates an `ObjectiveMechanism` that is used to monitor and
evaluate the values specified in the **monitor_for_control** argument of the ControlMechanism's constructor.
The **monitor_for_control** argument must be a list, each item of which must refer to a `Mechanism` or the `OutputState`
of one.  These are assigned to the ObjectiveMechanism's `monitored_values <ObjectiveMechanism>` attribute, and the
ObjectiveMechanism is referenced by the ControlMechanism's
`monitoring_mechanism <ControlMechanism_Base.monitoring_mechanism>` attribute. The ObjectiveMechanism monitors each
Mechanism and/or OutputState listed in the ControlMechanism's
`monitor_for_control <ControlMechanism_Base.monitor_for_control>` attribute, and evaluates them using the its
`function <ControlMechanism_Base.function>`. This information is used to set the `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>`
 for each of the ControlMechanism's ControlSignals.

.. _ControlMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

A ControlMechanism that is a System's `controller` is always the last Mechanism to be executed in a `TRIAL` for that
System (see `System Control <System_Execution_Control>` and `Execution <System_Execution>`).  The ControlMechanism's
`function <ControlMechanism_Base.function>` takes as its input the `value <InputState.value>` of its *ERROR_SIGNAL*
`input_state <Mechanism.input_state>`, and uses that to determine its
`allocation_policy <ControlMechanism_Base.allocation_policy>` which specifies the value assigned to the
`allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` of each of its `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>`.  Each
ControlSignal uses that value to calculate its `intensity <ControlSignal.intensity>`, which is used by its
`ControlProjection(s) <ControlProjection>` to modulate the value of the ParameterState(s) for the parameter(s)
it controls, which are then used in the subsequent `TRIAL` of execution.

.. note::
   A `ParameterState` that receives a `ControlProjection` does not update its value until its owner Mechanism
   executes (see `Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).  This means that even if a
   ControlMechanism has executed, a parameter that it controls will not assume its new value until the Mechanism
   to which it belongs has executed.

    COMMENT:
        Description:
            Protocol for instantiating unassigned ControlProjections (i.e., w/o a sender specified):
               If sender is not specified for a ControlProjection (e.g., in a parameter specification tuple)
                   it is flagged for deferred_init() in its __init__ method
               When the next ControlMechanism is instantiated, if its params[MAKE_DEFAULT_CONTROLLER] == True
                   its _assign_as_controller method is called in _instantiate_attributes_after_function;
                   it then iterates through all of the ParameterStates of all of the Mechanisms in its System,
                   identifies ones without a sender specified, calls its deferred_init() method,
                   instantiates a ControlSignal for it, and assigns it as the ControlProjection's sender.

            MONITOR_FOR_CONTROL param determines which States will be monitored.
                specifies the OutputStates of the terminal Mechanisms in the System to be monitored by ControlMechanism
                this specification overrides any in System.params[], but can be overridden by Mechanism.params[]
                ?? if MonitoredOutputStates appears alone, it will be used to determine how States are assigned from
                    System.executionGraph by default
                if MonitoredOutputStatesOption is used, it applies to any Mechanisms specified in the list for which
                    no OutputStates are listed; it is overridden for any Mechanism for which OutputStates are
                    explicitly listed
