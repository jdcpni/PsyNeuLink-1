Overview
--------

An EVCMechanism is a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` that manages a "portfolio" of
`ControlSignals <ControlSignal>` that regulate the performance of the System to which they belong. The
EVCMechanism is one of the most powerful, but also one of the most complex components in PsyNeuLink.  It is
designed to implement a form of the Expected Value of Control (EVC) Theory described in
`Shenhav et al. (2013) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23889930>`_, which provides useful background concerning
the purpose and structure of the EVCMechanism.

An EVCMechanism belongs to a `System` specified in its `system <EVCMechanism.system>` attribute, and a `ControlSignal`
for each parameter of the Components in the `system <EVCMechanism.system>` that it controls.  Each ControlSignal is
associated with a `ControlProjection` that regulates the value of the parameter it controls, with the magnitude of
that regulation determined by the ControlSignal's `intensity`.  A particular combination of ControlSignal `intensity`
values is called an `allocation_policy`. When a `System` is executed that uses an EVCMechanism as its `controller
<System_Base.controller>`, it concludes by executing the EVCMechanism which determines its `allocation_policy` for the
next `TRIAL`.  That, in turn, determines the `intensity` for each of the ControlSignals, and therefore the values of
the parameters being controlled on the next `TRIAL`.


.. _EVCMechanism_EVC:

Expected Value of Control (EVC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EVCMechanism uses it `function <EVCMechanism.function>` to select an `allocation_policy` for its `system
<EVCMechanism.system>`.  In the `default configuration <EVC_Default_Configuration>`, an EVCMechanism carries out an
exhaustive evaluation of allocation policies, simulating its `system <EVCMechanism.system>` under each, and using an
`ObjectiveMechanism` and several `auxiliary functions <EVCMechanism_Auxiliary_Functions>` to calculate the **expected
value of control (EVC)** for each `allocation_policy`: a cost-benefit analysis that weighs the `cost
<ControlSignal.cost> of the ControlSignals against the outcome of the `system <EVCMechanism.system>` \s performance for
a given `allocation_policy`. The EVCMechanism selects the `allocation_policy` that generates the maximum EVC, and
implements that for the next `TRIAL`. Each step of this procedure can be modified, or replaced entirely, by assigning
custom functions to corresponding parameters of the EVCMechanism, as described `below <EVCMechanism_Functions>`.

.. _EVCMechanism_Creation:

Creating an EVCMechanism
------------------------

An EVCMechanism can be created in any of the ways used to `create Mechanisms <Mechanism_Creation>`;  it is also
created automatically when a `System` is created and the EVCMechanism class is specified in the **controller**
argument of the System's constructor (see `System_Creation`).

When an EVCMechanism is created explicitly (using its constructor), it creates:

* an `ObjectiveMechanism`, using the list of `OutputState` specifications in the **monitor_for_control** argument of
  the EVCMechanism's constructor to specify the ObjectiveMechanism's `monitored_values
  <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_values>` attribute, and the function specified in the **outcome_function** argument
  of the EVCMechanism's constructor to specify the ObjectiveMechanism's `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`;
..
* a `MappingProjection` that projects from the ObjectiveMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputState
  <ObjectiveMechanism_Structure>` to the EVCMechanism's `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>`.
..
* a `prediction Mechanism <EVCMechanism_Prediction_Mechanisms>` for each `ORIGIN` Mechanism in its `system
  <EVCMechanism.system>`, assigns a MappingProjection to each from the `system <EVCMechanism.system>`,
  and assigns these to its `prediction_mechanisms` attribute.

When an EVCMechanism is created automatically as part of a `System <System_Creation>`, the same set of Components are
created as described above, with the following modifications:

* the `OutputStates <OutputState>` specified in the System's `monitor_for_control <System_Base.monitor_for_control>`
  attribute are used to create the ObjectiveMechanism
..
* a `ControlSignal` is created and assigned to the EVCMechanisn's `control_signals <EVCMechanism.control_signals>`
  attribute for every parameter of any `Component` in the System that has been specified for control (that is,
  by including a `ControlProjection` or `ControlSignal` in a `tuple specification <>` for the parameter, or by
  specifying the parameter (or its associated `ParameterState`) in the **control_signals** argument of a
  `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism_Control_Signals>`.

An EVCMechanism that has been constructed automatically can be customized by assigning values to its attributes (e.g.,
those described above, or its `function <EVCMechanism.function>` as described under `EVC_Default_Configuration `below).

.. _EVCMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

An EVCMechanism belongs to a `System` (identified in its `system <EVCMechanism.system>` attribute), and has a
specialized set of Components that support its operation.  It receives its input from the *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputState
<ObjectiveMechanism_Structure>` of an `ObjectiveMechanism` (identified in its `monitoring_mechanism
<EVCMechansm.monitoring_mechanism>` attribute), and has a specialized set of `functions <EVCMechanism_Functions>` and
`mechanisms <EVCMechanism_Prediction_Mechanisms>` that it can use to simulate and evaluate the performance of its
`system <EVCMechanism.system>` under the influence of different values of its `ControlSignals
<EVCMechanism_ControlSignals>`.  Each of these specialized Components is described below.


ObjectiveMechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _EVCMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism:

When an EVCMechanism is created, it creates an `ObjectiveMechanism` that is assigned as its `monitoring_mechanism
<EVCMechanism.monitoring_mechanism>` attribute, and can be used to evaluate the performance of its `system
<EVCMechanism.system>`.  The `monitoring_mechanism <EVCMechanism.monitoring_mechanism>` receives a `MappingProjection`
from each of the `OutputStates <OutputState>` specified in the EVCMechanism's `monitored_output_states
<EVCMechanism.monitored_output_states>` attribute (also listed in the `monitored_values
<ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_values>` attribute of the `monitoring_mechanism <EVCMechanism.monitoring_mechanism>`),
and the EVCMechanism's `outcome_function <EVCMechanism.outcome_function>` is assinged as the `monitoring_mechanism
<EVCMechanism.monitoring_mechanism>`'s `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`.  By default, this is a
`LinearCombination` function that calculates the product of the `value <OutputState.value>` of the OutputStates
specified in `monitored_output_states <EVCMechanism.monitored_output_states>`.  However, the contribution of individual
OutputStates can be specified in the **monitor_for_control** argument of the EVCMechanism's constructor, by using a
tuple that includes a weight and exponent along with the OutputState for its entry in the list (see
`MonitoredOutputState Tuple <ObjectiveMechanism_OutputState_Tuple>`).  The outcome calcuated by the
`monitoring_mechanism <EVCMechanism.monitoring_mechanism>` is conveyed to the EVCMechanism and assigned as the
`value <InputState.value>` of its `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>`.


.. _EVCMechanism_Prediction_Mechanisms:

Prediction Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are used to provide input to the `system <EVCMechanism.system>` when the EVCMechanism's default `function
<EVCMechanism.function>` (`ControlSignalGridSearch`) `simulates its execution <EVC_Default_Configuration>` to evaluate
the EVC for each `allocation_policy`.  When an EVCMechanism is created, a prediction Mechanism is created for each
`ORIGIN` Mechanism in its `system <EVCMechanism.system>`, and for each `Projection` received by an `ORIGIN` Mechanism,
a `MappingProjection` from the same source is created that projects to the corresponding prediction Mechanism. The type
of `Mechanism` used for the prediction Mechanisms is specified by the EVCMechanism's `prediction_mechanism_type`
attribute, and their parameters can be specified with the `prediction_mechanism_params` attribute. The default type is
an 'IntegratorMechanism`, that calculates an exponentially weighted time-average of its input. The prediction mechanisms
for an EVCMechanism are listed in its `prediction_mechanisms` attribute.


.. _EVCMechanism_Functions:

Function
~~~~~~~~

The `function <EVCMechanism.function>` of an EVCMechanism returns an `allocation_policy` -- that is, an `allocation
<ControlSignal.allocation>` for each `ControlSignal` listed in its `control_signals <EVCMechanism.control_signals>`
attribute -- that are used by the Components of the EVCMechanism's `system <EVCMechanism.system>` in the next `TRIAL`
of execution.  The default is `ControlSignalGridSearch` (see `EVC_Default_Configuration`), but any function can be used
that returns an appropriate value (i.e., that specifies an `allocation_policy` for the number of `ControlSignals
<EVCMechanism_ControlSignals>` in the EVCMechanism's `control_signals` attribute, using the correct format for the
`allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` value of each ControlSignal).  In addition to its primary `function
<EVCMechanism.function>`, an EVCMechanism has a set of `auxiliary functions <EVCMechanism_Auxiliary_Functions>` that
evaluate the performance of its `system <EVCMechanism.system>` (`outcome_function <EVCMechanism.outcome_function>`),
the `cost <ControlSignal.cost>` associated with its ControlSignals (`cost_function <EVCMechanism.cost_function>`), and
combine these (combine_outcome_and_cost_function <EVCMechanism.combine_outcome_and_cost_function>`) to calculate the
`EVC <EVCMechanism_EVC>`.  These functions are used by the EVCMechanism's default function to select an
`allocation_policy` with the maximum EVC among a range of policies specified by its ControlSignals, as described below.

.. _EVCMechanism_Default_Configuration:

Default Configuration of EVC Function and its Auxiliary Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In its default configuration, an EVCMechanism simulates and evaluates the performance of its `system
<EVCMechanism.system>` under a set of allocation_policies determined by the `allocation_samples
<ControlSignal.allocation_samples>` attributes of its `ControlSignals <EVCMechanism_ControlSignals>`, and implements
the one that generates the maximum `EVC <EVCMechanism_EVC>`.  This is carried out by the EVCMechanism's
default `function <EVCMechanism.function>` and four auxiliary functions, as described below.

The default `function <EVCMechanism.function>` of an EVCMechanism is `ControlSignalGridSearch`. It identifies the
`allocation_policy` with the maximum `EVC <EVCMechanism_EVC>` by a conducting an exhaustive search over every possible
`allocation_policy`— that is, all combinations of `allocation <ControlSignal.allication>` values for its `ControlSignal
<EVCMechanism_ControlSignals>`, where the `allocation <ControlSignal.allication>` values sampled for each ControlSignal
are determined by its `allocation_samples` attribute.  For each `allocation_policy`, the EVCMechanism executes the
`system <EVCMechanism.system>`, evaluates the `EVC <EVCMechanism_EVC>` for that policy, and returns the
`allocation_policy` that yields the greatest EVC value. The following steps are used to calculate the EVC in each
`allocation_policy`:

  * **Implement the policy and simulate the system** - assign the `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` that the
    selected `allocation_policy` specifies for each ControlSignal, and then simulate these System using the
    corresponding parameter values.

  * **Calculate outcome** - combine the `value <OutputState.value>` \s of the OutputStates listed in the
    EVCMechanism's `monitored_output_states <EVCMechanism.monitored_output_states>` attribute using the function
    specified by its `outcome_function <EVCMechanism.outcome_function>` attribute (this is done by the EVCMechanism's
    `monitoring_mechanism <EVCMechanism.monitoring_mechanism>`, and passed to the EVCMechanism's `primary InputState
    <InputState_Primary>`);  the default is take the product of all the values, but this can be configured
    to weight and/or exponentiate individual values (see  documentation for `outcome_function
    <EVCMechanism.outcome_function>`).
  ..
  * **Calculate EVC** - by calling the EVCMechanism's `value_function <EVCMechanism.value_function>` with the
    outcome (received from the `monitoring_mechanism`) and a list of the `costs <ControlSignal.cost>` \s of its
    `ControlSignals <EVCMechanism_ControlSignals>`; default `value_function <EVCMechanism.value_function>` calls
    to additional auxiliary functions:  first it calls the `cost_function <EVCMechanism.cost_function>` which sums
    the costs, though this can be configured to weight and/or exponentiate individual costs (see `cost_function
    <EVCMechanism.cost_function>` attribute);  it then calls the `combine_outcome_and_cost_function
    <EVCMechanism.combine_outcome_and_cost_function>`, which subtracts the sum of the costs from the outcome
    to generate the EVC, though this too can be configured (see documentation for `combine_outcome_and_cost_function
    <EVCMechanism.combine_outcome_and_cost_function>`).

In addition to modifying the default functions (as noted above), any or all of them can be replaced with
a custom function to modify how the `allocation_policy` is determined, so long as the custom function accepts
arguments and return values that are compatible with any that call that function (see note below).

.. _EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions:

    .. note::
       The `EVCMechanism auxiliary functions <EVC_Auxiliary_Functions>` described above are all implemented as
       PsyNeuLink `Functions <Function>`.  Therefore, to call a function itself, it must be referenced as
       ``<EVCMechanism>.<function_attribute>.function``.  A custom function assigned to one of the auxiliary functions
       can be either a PsyNeuLink `Function <Function>`, or a generic python function or method (including a lambda
       function).  If it is one of the latter, it is automatically "wrapped" as a PsyNeuLink `Function <Function>`
       (specifically, it is assigned as the `function <UserDefinedFunction.function>` attribute of a
       `UserDefinedFunction` object), so that it can be referenced and called in the same manner as
       the default function assignment. Therefore, once assigned, it too must be referenced as
       ``<EVCMechanism>.<function_attribute>.function``.

.. _EVCMechanism_ControlSignals:

ControlSignals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OutputStates of an EVCMechanism (like any `ControlMechanism`) are a set of `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>`, that
are listed in its `control_signals <EVCMechanism.control_signals>` attribute (as well as its `output_states
<ControlMechanism.output_states>` attribute).  Each ControlSignal is assigned a  `ControlProjection` that projects to
the `ParameterState` for a parameter controlled by the EVCMechanism.  When an EVCMechanism is `created automatically
<EVCMechanism_Creation>`, it is assigned one ControlSignal for each of the parameters `specified for control
<ControlMechanism_Control_Signals>` in its `system <EVCMechanism.system>`; if it is created directly, then it creates
one ControlSignal for each of the parameters specified in the **control_signals** argument of its constructor.
ControlSignals can be added to an EVCMechanism using its `assign_params` method.  Each ControlSignal is assigned an
item of the EVCMechanism's `allocation_policy`, that determines its `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` for a given
`TRIAL` of execution.  The `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` is used by a ControlSignal to determine its
`intensity <ControlSignal.intensity>`, which is then assigned as the `value <ConrolProjection.value>` of the
ControlSignal's ControlProjection.   The `value <ControlProjection>` of the ControlProjection is used by the
`ParameterState` to which it projects to modify the value of the parameter (see `ControlSignal_Modulation` for
description of how a ControlSignal modulates the value of a parameter it controls).  A ControlSignal also calculates a
`cost <ControlSignal.cost>`, based on its `intensity <ControlSignal.intensity>` and/or its time course. The
`cost <ControlSignal.cost>` is included in the evaluation that the EVCMechanism carries out for a given
`allocation_policy`, and that it uses to adapt the ControlSignal's `allocation  <ControlSignal.allocation>` in the
future.  When the EVCMechanism chooses an `allocation_policy` to evaluate,  it selects an allocation value from the
ControlSignal's `allocation_samples <ControlSignal.allocation_samples>` attribute.


.. _EVCMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

An EVCMechanism, like any `ControlMechanism`, is always the last `Mechanism` to be executed in a `TRIAL` for its
`system <EVCMechanism.system>` (see `System Control <System_Execution_Control>` and `Execution <System_Execution>`).
When an EVCMechanism is executed, it updates the value of its `prediction_mechanisms` and `monitoring_mechanism`,
and then calls its `function <EVCMechanism.function>`, which determines and implements the `allocation_policy` for
the next `TRIAL` of its `system <EVCMechanism.system>` \s execution.  The default `function <EVCMechanism.function>`
executes the following steps (described in greater detailed `above <EVC_Default_Configuration>`):

* samples every allocation_policy (i.e., every combination of the `allocation` \s specified for the EVCMechanism's
  ControlSignals specified by their `allocation_samples` attributes);  for each `allocation_policy`, it:

  * Executes the EVCMechanism's `system <EVCMechanism.system>` with the parameter values specified by that
    `allocation_policy`;  this includes the EVCMechanism's `monitoring_mechanism`, which executes the function
    specified in the EVCMechanism's `outcome_function <EVCMechanism.outcome_function>`, and provides the result
    to the EVCMechanism.

  * Calls the EVCMechanism's `value_function <EVCMechanism.value_function>`, which in turn calls EVCMechanism's
    `cost_function <EVCMechanism.cost_function>` and `combine_outcome_and_cost_function
    <EVCMechanism.combine_outcome_and_cost_function>` to evaluate the EVC for that `allocation_policy`.

  * Selects and returns the `allocation_policy` that generates the maximum EVC value.

This procedure can be modified by specifying a custom function for any or all of the `functions
<EVC_Auxiliary_Functions>` referred to above.


.. _EVCMechanism_Examples:

Examples
--------

The following example implements a System with an EVCMechanism (and two processes not shown)::

    mySystem = system(processes=[myRewardProcess, myDecisionProcess],
                      controller=EVCMechanism,
                      monitor_for_control=[Reward, DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE,(RESPONSE_TIME, -1, 1)],

It uses the System's `monitor_for_control` argument to assign three outputStates to be monitored.  The first one
references the Reward Mechanism (not shown);  its `primary outputState <OutputState_Primary>` will be used by default.
The second and third use keywords that are the names of outputStates of a  `DDM` Mechanism (also not shown).
The last one (RESPONSE_TIME) is assigned an exponent of -1 and weight of 1. As a result, each calculation of the EVC
computation will multiply the value of the primary outputState of the Reward Mechanism by the value of the
DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE outputState of the DDM Mechanism, and then divide that by the value of the RESPONSE_TIME
outputState of the DDM Mechanism.

COMMENT:
ADD: This example specifies the EVCMechanism on its own, and then uses it for a System.

        specifies the function used to combine the outcome and cost associated with the current `allocation_policy`,

        execution. The default function, `ControlSignalGridSearch`, conducts an exhaustive (*grid*) search of all
        combinations of the `allocation_samples` of its ControlSignals (and contained in its
        `control_signal_search_space` attribute), by executing the System (using `run_simulation`) for each
        combination, evaluating the result using `value_function`, and returning the `allocation_policy` that yielded
        the greatest `EVC <EVCMechanism_EVC>` value (see `EVCMechanism_Default_Configuration` for additional details).

        (and provides access to its attributes, including `control_signal_search_space`), and must return an array with
        the same format (number and type of elements) as the EVCMechanism's `allocation_policy` attribute.

    COMMENT

    allocation_policy : 2d np.array : defaultControlAllocation
        determines the value assigned as the `variable <ControlSignal.variable>` for each `ControlSignal` and its
        associated `ControlProjection`.  Each item of the array must be a 1d array (usually containing a scalar)
        that specifies an `allocation` for the corresponding ControlSignal, and the number of items must equal the
        number of ControlSignals in the EVCMechanism's `control_signals` attribute.

    value_function : function : default ValueFunction
        calculates the `EVC <EVCMechanism_EVC>` for a given `allocation_policy`.  It takes as its arguments an
        `EVCMechanism`, an **outcome** value and a list or ndarray of **costs**, uses these to calculate an EVC,
        and returns a three item tuple with the calculated EVC, and the outcome value and aggregated value of costs
        used to calculate the EVC.  The default, `ValueFunction`,  calls the EVCMechanism's `cost_function
        <EVCMechanism.cost_function>` to aggregate the value of the costs, and then calls its
        `combine_outcome_and_costs <EVCMechanism.combine_outcome_and_costs>` to calculate the EVC from the outcome
        and aggregated cost (see `EVCMechanism_Default_Configuration` for additional details).  A custom
        function can be assigned to `value_function` so long as it returns a tuple with three items: the calculated
        EVC (which must be a scalar value), and the outcome and cost from which it was calculated (these can be scalar
        values or `None`). If used with the EVCMechanism's default `function <EVCMechanism.function>`, a custom
        `value_function` must accommodate three arguments (passed by name): a **controller** argument that is the
        EVCMechanism for which it is carrying out the calculation; an **outcome** argument that is a value; and a
        `costs` argument that is a list or ndarray.  A custom function assigned to `value_function` can also call any
        of the `helper functions <EVCMechanism_Auxiliary_Functions>` that it calls (however, see `note
        <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` above).

    outcome_function : function : default LinearCombination(operation=PRODUCT)
        calculates a measure of performance of the EVCMechanism's `system <EVCMechanism.system>` for the current
        `allocation_policy`.

        .. note::

            This function is not called by the EVCMechanism directly; it is assigned to its
            `monitoring_mechanism` when that is created (or when a new assignment is made to its `outcome_function
            <EVCMechanism.outcome_function>` attribute), and then called when the `monitoring_mechanism
            <EVCMechanism.monitoring>` executes.

        The default function combines the values of the OutputStates listed in the EVCMechanism's
        `monitored_output_states <EVCMechanism.monitored_output_states>` attribute (and the `monitoring_mechanism
        <EVCMechanism.monitoring_mechanism>`'s `monitored_values <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_values>` attribute)
        by taking their elementwise (Hadamard) product.  Any weighs and exponents `specified in a tuple
        <ObjectiveMechanism_OutputState_Tuple>` for an OutputState in the **monitor_for_control** argument of
        the EVCMechanism's constructor are used as the `weights <LinearCombination.weights>` and
        `exponents <LinearCombination.exponents>` parameters of the `LinearCombination` (default) function. The
        default function can be replaced with any `custom function <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` that
        accepts an array of values as its input and returns a scalar value.

    cost_function : function : default LinearCombination(operation=SUM)
        calculates the cost of the `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>` for the current `allocation_policy`.  The default
        function sums the `cost <ControlSignal.cost>` of each of the EVCMechanism's `ControlSignals
        <EVCMechanism_ControlSignals>`.  The `weights <LinearCombination.weights>` and/or `exponents
        <LinearCombination.exponents>` parameters of the function can be used, respectively, to scale and/or
        exponentiate the contribution of each ControlSignal cost to the combined cost.  These must be specified as
        1d arrays in a *WEIGHTS* and/or *EXPONENTS* entry of a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>`
        assigned to the **params** argument of the constructor of a `LinearCombination` function; the length of
        each array must equal the number of (and the values listed in the same order as) the ControlSignals in the
        EVCMechanism's `control_signals <EVCMechanism.control_signals>` attribute. The default function can also be
        replaced with any `custom function <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` that takes an array as
        input and returns a scalar value.  If used with the EVCMechanism's default `value_function
        <EVCMechanism.value_function>`, a custom `cost_function <EVCMechanism.cost_function>` must accommodate two
        arguments (passed by name): a **controller** argument that is the EVCMechanism itself;  and a **costs**
        argument that is a 1d array of scalar values specifying the `cost <ControlSignal.cost>` for each ControlSignal
        listed in the `control_signals` attribute of the ControlMechanism specified in the **controller** argument.

    combine_outcome_and_cost_function : function : default LinearCombination(operation=SUM)
        combines the outcome and cost for given `allocation_policy` to determine its `EVC <EVCMechanisms_EVC>`. The
        default function subtracts the cost from the outcome, and returns the difference.  This can be modified using
        the `weights <LinearCombination.weights>` and/or `exponents <LinearCombination.exponents>` parameters of the
        function, as described for the `cost_function <EVCMechanisms.cost_function>`.  The default function can also be
        replaced with any `custom function <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` that returns a scalar value.  If used with the EVCMechanism's default `value_function`, a custom
        If used with the EVCMechanism's default `value_function`, a custom combine_outcome_and_cost_function must
        accomoudate three arguments (passed by name): a **controller** argument that is the EVCMechanism itself; an
        **outcome** argument that is a 1d array with the outcome of the current `allocation_policy`; and a **cost**
        argument that is 1d array with the cost of the current `allocation_policy`.

    control_signal_search_space : 2d np.array
        an array each item of which is an `allocation_policy`.  By default, it is assigned the set of all possible
        allocation policies, using np.meshgrid to construct all permutations of `ControlSignal` values from the set
        specified for each by its `allocation_samples <EVCMechanism.allocation_samples>` attribute.

    EVC_max : 1d np.array with single value
        the maximum `EVC <EVCMechanism_EVC>` value over all allocation policies in `control_signal_search_space`.

    EVC_max_state_values : 2d np.array
        an array of the values for the OutputStates in `monitored_output_states` using the `allocation_policy` that
        generated `EVC_max`.

    EVC_max_policy : 1d np.array
        an array of the ControlSignal `intensity <ControlSignal.intensity> values for the allocation policy that
        generated `EVC_max`.

    save_all_values_and_policies : bool : default False
        specifies whether or not to save every `allocation_policy and associated EVC value (in addition to the max).
        If it is specified, each `allocation_policy` tested in the `control_signal_search_space` is saved in
        `EVC_policies`, and their values are saved in `EVC_values`.

    EVC_policies : 2d np.array
        array with every `allocation_policy` tested in `control_signal_search_space`.  The `EVC <EVCMechanism_EVC>`
        value of each is stored in `EVC_values`.

    EVC_values :  1d np.array
        array of `EVC <EVCMechanism_EVC>` values, each of which corresponds to an `allocation_policy` in `EVC_policies`;
