Overview
--------

An EVCMechanism is a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` that manages a "portfolio" of
`ControlSignals <ControlSignal>` that regulate the performance of the system to which they belong. The
EVCMechanism is one of the most powerful, but also one of the most complex components in PsyNeuLink.  It is
designed to implement a form of the Expected Value of Control (EVC) Theory described in
`Shenhav et al. (2013) <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23889930>`_, which provides useful background concerning
the purpose and structure of the EVCMechanism.

An EVCMechanism has one `ControlSignal` for each parameter of the mechanism or function that it controls.  Each
ControlSignal is associated with a `ControlProjection`.  The ControlProjection regulates the value of the parameter
it controls, with the magnitude of that regulation determined by the ControlSignal's `intensity`. A
particular combination of ControlSignal intensities is called an `allocation_policy`. When a system is executed,
it concludes by executing the EVCMechanism, which determines the `allocation_policy` (i.e., the ControlSignal
intensities, and thereby the values of the parameters being controlled) in the next `TRIAL`.

.. _EVCMechanism_EVC:

The procedure by which the EVCMechanism selects an `allocation_policy` when it is executed is determined by its
`function <EVCMechanism.function>` attribute. By default, this evaluates the performance of the system under every
possible `allocation_policy`, and chooses the best one. It does this by simulating the system under each
`allocation_policy`, and evaluating the expected value of control (EVC): a cost-benefit analysis that weighs
the cost of the ControlSignals against the outcome of performance for the given policy.  The EVCMechanism then
selects the `allocation_policy` that generates the maximum EVC, and that allocation_policy is implemented for the
next `TRIAL`. Each step of this procedure can be modified, or it can be replaced entirely, by assigning
custom functions to corresponding parameters of the EVCMechanism, as described under `EVC_Calculation` below.

.. _EVCMechanism_Creation:

Creating an EVCMechanism
------------------------

An EVCMechanism is generated automatically when a system is created and an EVCMechanism is specified as its
`controller` attribute (see `Controller <System_Execution_Control>`).  However, it can also be created using the
standard Python method of calling its constructor. An EVCMechanism that has been constructed automatically can be
customized by assigning values to its attributes (e.g., its functions, as described under `EVC_Calculation` below).

When an EVCMechanism is constructed automatically, it creates an `ObjectiveMechanism` (specified in its
`montioring_mechanism` attribute) that is used to monitor and evaluate the system's performance.  The
ObjectiveMechanism monitors each mechanism and/or outputState listed in the EVCMechanism's
'monitor_for_control <EVCMechanism.monitor_for_control>` attribute, and evaluates them using the function specified in
the EVCMechanism's `outcome_function` attribute. This information is used to set the `allocation` values for the
EVCMechanism's  `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>`.  Each ControlSignal is implemented as an `outputState
<OutputState>` of the EVCMechanism, that is assigned a  `ControlProjections <ControlProjection>` which projects to the
`parameterStates <ParameterState>` for the parameters of the mechanisms and/or functions controlled by that
ControlSignal.  In addition, a set of prediction mechanisms  are created that are used to keep a running average of
inputs to the system over the course of multiple executions.   These averages are used to generate input to the
system when the EVCMechanism simulates its execution. Each of these specialized components is described in the
sections that follow.

.. _EVCMechanism_InputStates:
.. _EVCMechanism_MonitoredOutputStates:

ObjectiveMechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An EVCMechanism uses an `ObjectiveMechanism` to evaluate the performance of the system. The ObjectiveMechanism is
assigned a projection from each of the mechanisms and/or outputStates specified in EVCMechanism's
`monitor_for_control <EVCMechanism.monitor_for_control>` attribute, which it evaluates using the function specified in
the EVCMechanism's `outcome_function` attribute.  By default, the ObjectiveMechanism is assigned a projection from
the `primary outputState <OutputState_Primary>` of every `TERMINAL` mechanism in the system, and its function
calculates the product of their values.  However, the contribution of each item listed in
`monitor_for_control <EVCMechanism.monitor_for_control>` can be specified using the EVCMechanism's
`monitor_for_control_weights_and_exponents` attribute` (see `below <EVCMechanism_Examples>` for examples).
The outputStates of the system being monitored by an EVCMechanism are listed in its `monitored_output_states` attribute.

.. _EVC_Function

Function
~~~~~~~~

The `function <EVCMechanism.function>` of an EVCMechanism returns an `allocation_policy` -- that is, the `intensity` of
each of its `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>` -- that will be used in the next round of the system's execution.  Any
function can be used that returns an appropriate value (i.e., that specifies an `allocation_policy` for the exact
number of ControlSignals in the EVCMechanism's `control_signals` attribute, using the correct format for the `allocation`
value of each ControlSignal). The default function is `ControlSignalGridSearch`, which evaluates the performance of the
system under a range of specified allocationPolicies, and returns the `allocation_policy` that generates the best
performance (the greatest EVC). This evaluation and selection procedure, including the four evaluation functions that it
uses (all of which are customizable), is described below.

.. _EVC_Calculation:

EVC Calculation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default EVC `function <EVCMechanism.function>` calculates the expected value of control (EVC) by a conducting a
grid search over every possible `allocation_policy`.  The set of allocationPolicies sampled is determined by the
`allocation_samples` attribute of each `ControlSignal`. Each policy is constructed by drawing one value from the
`allocation_samples` attribute of each of the EVCMechanism's ControlSignals.  An `allocation_policy` is constructed
for every possible combination of values, and stored in the EVCMechanism's `control_signal_search_space` attribute.  The
EVCMechanism's `run_simulation` method is then used to simulate the system under each `allocation_policy` in
`control_signal_search_space`, calculate the EVC for each of those policies, and return the policy with the greatest EVC.
By default, only the maximum EVC is saved and returned.  However, by setting the `save_all_values_and_policies`
attribute to `True`, each policy and its EVC can be saved for each simulation run (in `EVC_policies` and `EVC_values`,
respectively). The EVC is calculated for each policy using the following four functions, each of which can be
customized by using the EVCMechanism's `assign_params` method to designate custom functions (the safest way),
or by assigning them directly to the corresponding attribute (see `note <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>`
below):

COMMENT:
  [TBI:]  The ``control_signal_search_space`` described above is constructed by default.  However, this can be customized
          by assigning either a 2d array or a function that returns a 2d array to the ``control_signal_search_space``
          attribute.  The first dimension (or axis 0) of the 2d array must be an array of control allocation
          policies (of any length), each of which contains a value for each ControlProjection in the
          EVCMechanism, assigned in the same order they are listed in its ``control_projections`` attribute.
COMMENT

.. _EVC_Auxiliary_Functions:

COMMENT:
    MENTION HIERARCHY
COMMENT

* `value_function` - this is an "orchestrating" function that calls the three subordinate functions described below,
  which do the actual work of evaluating the performance of the system and the `cost` of the ControlSignals under the
  current `allocation_policy`, and combining these to calculate the EVC.  This function can be replaced with a
  user-defined function to fully customize the calculation of the EVC, by assigning a custom function to the
  `value_function` attribute of the EVCMechanism (see `note <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` below).
..
* `outcome_function` - this combines the values of the outputStates in the EVCMechanism's `monitored_output_states`
  attribute to generate an aggregated outcome value for the current `allocation_policy`. The default is the
  `LinearCombination` function, which computes an elementwise (Hadamard) product of the outputState values, using any
  `weights and/or exponents specified for the outputStates <ObjectiveMechanism_OutputState_Tuple>` to scale and/or
  exponentiate the contribution that each makes to the aggregated outcome (see `examples <EVCMechanism_Examples>`).
  Evaluation of the system's performance can be further customized by specifying a custom function for the
  EVCMechanism's `outcome_function` attribute (see `note <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` below).
..
* `cost_function` - this combines the `cost` of the EVCMechanism's ControlSignals to generate an aggregated cost for
  the current `allocation_policy`.  The default is the `LinearCombination` function, which sums the costs.  The
  evaluation of cost can be further customized by specifying a custom function for the `cost_function` attribute.
..
* `combine_outcome_and_cost_function` - this combines the aggregated outcome and aggregated `cost` values for the
  current `allocation_policy`, to determine the EVC for that policy.  The default is the `LinearCombination`
  function, which subtracts the aggregated cost from the aggregated outcome. The way in which the outcome and cost
  are combined to determine the EVC can be customized by specifying a custom function for the
  `combine_outcome_and_cost_function` attribute (see `note <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` below).

.. _EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions:

.. note::
   The EVCMechanism function attributes described above are all implemented as PsyNeuLink `Function <Function>` objects
   (so that, among other reasons, they can be parameterized using a `params` dictionary).  Therefore, to call the
   function itself, it must be referenced as ``<EVCMechanism>.<function_attribute>.function``.  A custom function
   assigned to one of the function attributes can be either a PsyNeuLink `Function <Function>`, or a generic python
   function or method (including a lambda function).  However, if it is one of the latter, it is automatically
   "wrapped" as a PsyNeuLink `Function <Function>` (specifically, it is assigned as the
   `function <UserDefinedFunction.function>` attribute of a `UserDefinedFunction` object), so that it can be called
   in the same manner as the default function assignment. Therefore, once assigned, it too must be referenced as
   ``<EVCMechanism>.<function_attribute>.function``.


.. _EVCMechanism_ControlSignal:

ControlSignals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `ControlSignal` is used to regulate the parameter of a Mechanism or its function. An EVCMechanism has one
ControlSignal for each parameter that it controls (ControlSignal is a special class of `OutputState` used by a
`ConrolMechanism`). When an EVCMechanism is `created automatically <EVCMechanism_Creation>`, it creates a ControlSignal
for each parameter that has been specified for control in the System (a parameter is specified  for control by assigning
it a `ControlProjection` or `ControlSignal`; see `ParameterState_Specification`).  The ControlSignals of an EVCMechanism
are listed in it `control_signals <EVCMechanism.control_signals>` attribute. Each ControlSignal is associated with a
`ControlProjection` that projects to the `ParameterState` for the parameter controlled by that ControlSignal. The
EVCMechanism's `function <EVCMechanism.function>` assigns an `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` value to each of
its ControlSignals. The `allocation <ControlSignal.allocadtion>` for a given ControlSignal determines that
ControlSignal's `intensity`, which is then assigned as the `value <ConrolProjection.value>` of the ControlSignal's
ControlProjection.  The  `value <ControlProjection>` of the ControlProjection is then used by the ParameterState
to which it projects to modify the value of the parameter for which it is responsible.  A ControlSignal also
calculates a `cost <ControlSignal.cost>`, based on its `intensity <ControlSignal.intensity>` and/or its time course.
The `cost <ControlSignal.cost>` is included in the evaluation that the EVCMechanism carries out for a given
`allocation_policy`, and that it uses to adapt the ControlSignal's `allocation <ControlSignal.allocation>` in the
future.  When the EVCMechanism chooses an `allocation_policy` to evaluate, it selects an allocation value from the
ControlSignal's `allocation_samples <ControlSignal.allocation_samples>` attribute.

.. _EVCMechanism_Prediction_Mechanisms:

Prediction Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each time the EVCMechanism is executed, it `simulates the execution <EVCMechanism_Execution>` of the system
in order to evaluate the system's performance.  To do so, it must provide an input to the system.  It uses its
prediction mechanisms to do this.  Each prediction mechanism provides an estimate of the input to an `ORIGIN`
mechanism in the system, based on a running average of inputs to that mechanism in previous rounds of execution.
The EVCMechanism uses these estimates to provide input to the system each time it simulates it to evaluate its
performance.  When an EVCMechanism is `created automatically <EVCMechanism_Creation>`, a prediction mechanism is
created for each `ORIGIN` mechanism in the system. For each projection received by the `ORIGIN` mechanism,
a `MappingProjection` from the same source is created that projects to the prediction mechanism.  The type of
mechanism used for the prediction mechanisms can be specified using the EVCMechanism's
`prediction_mechanism_type` attribute, and their parameters can be specified using the EVCMechanism's
`prediction_mechanism_params` attribute.  The default type is an 'IntegratorMechanism`, that calculates an
exponentially weighted time-average of its input.  The prediction mechanisms for an EVCMechanism are listed in its
`predictionMechanisms` attribute.

.. _EVCMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

When an EVCMechanism is executed, it updates the value of its `predictionMechanisms` and `monitoring_mechanism`,
and then calls its `function <EVCMechanism.function>`, which determines and implements the `allocation_policy` for
the next round of the system's execution.  By default, the EVCMechanism identifies and implements the
`allocation_policy` that maximizes the EVC evaluated for the outputStates it is monitoring, as described below.
However, this procedure can be modified by specifying a custom function for any or all of the functions described below.

.. _EVCMechanism_Default_Function:

The default `function <EVCMechanism.function>` for an EVCMechanism selects an `allocation_policy` by assessing
the performance of the system under each of the policies in its `control_signal_search_space`, and selecting the
one that yields the maximum EVC. The `control_signal_search_space` is constructed by creating a set of
allocationPolicies that represent all permutations of the `allocation` values to be sampled for each ControlSignal.
Each `allocation_policy` in the set is constructed by drawing one value from the `allocation_samples` of each
ControlSignal, and the set contains all combinations of these values.  For each `allocation_policy`, the default
`function <EVCMechanism.function>` calls the EVCMechanism's `value_function` which, in turn, carries out the
following steps:

* **Implement the allocation_policy.** Assign the `allocation <ControlSignal.ControlSignal.allocation>` value specified
  for each ControlSignal.
..
* **Simulate performance.**  Execute the system under the current `allocation_policy` using the EVCMechanism's
  `run_simulation` method and the value of its `predicted_inputs` attribute as the input to the system (this uses
  the history of previous trials to generate an average expected input value).
..
* **Calculate the EVC for the allocation_policy.**  This uses three functions:

    * the `outcome_function` calculates the **outcome** for the allocation_policy by aggregating the value of the
      outputStates the EVCMechanism monitors (listed in its `monitored_output_states` attribute);
    ..
    * the `cost_function` calculates the **cost** of the allocation_policy by aggregating the `cost` of the
      EVCMechanism's ControlSignals;
    ..
    * the `combine_outcome_and_cost_function` calculates the **value** (EVC) of the allocation_policy by subtracting the
      aggregated cost from the aggregated outcome.

If the `save_all_values_and_policies` attribute is `True`, the allocation policy is saved in the
EVCMechanism's `EVC_policies` attribute, and its value is saved in the `EVC_values` attribute. The
`function <EVCMechanism.function>` returns the allocation_policy that yielded the maximum EVC. This is then
implemented by assigning the `allocation` specified for each ControlSignal by the designated allocation_policy.
These allocations determine the value of the parameters being controlled in the next round of the system's execution.

This procedure can be modified by assigning custom functions to any or all of the ones described above, including the
EVCMechanism's `function <EVCMechanism.function>` itself.  The requirements for each are described in the function
attribute entries below.

.. _EVCMechanism_Examples:

Examples
--------

The following example implements a system with an EVCMechanism (and two processes not shown)::

    mySystem = system(processes=[myRewardProcess, myDecisionProcess],
                      controller=EVCMechanism,
                      monitor_for_control=[Reward, DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE,(RESPONSE_TIME, -1, 1)],

It uses the system's `monitor_for_control` argument to assign three outputStates to be monitored.  The first one
references the Reward mechanism (not shown);  its `primary outputState <OutputState_Primary>` will be used by default.
The second and third use keywords that are the names of outputStates of a  `DDM` mechanism (also not shown).
The last one (RESPONSE_TIME) is assigned an exponent of -1 and weight of 1. As a result, each calculation of the EVC
computation will multiply the value of the primary outputState of the Reward mechanism by the value of the
DDM_DECISION_VARIABLE outputState of the DDM mechanism, and then divide that by the value of the RESPONSE_TIME
outputState of the DDM mechanism.

COMMENT:
ADD: This example specifies the EVCMechanism on its own, and then uses it for a system.

    make_default_controller : bool : default True
        if `True`, calls deferred_init() for each ControlProjection in its system without a sender,
        creates a ControlSignal for it, and assigns itself as its sender.

    system : System
        the `system <System>` for which EVCMechanism is the `controller`.

    control_signals : ContentAddressableList[ControlSignal]
        list of `outputStates <OutputState>` for the EVCMechanism, each of which corresponds to one of its
        ControlSignals.

    predictionMechanisms : MechanismList
        a list of `prediction mechanisms <EVCMechanism_Prediction_Mechanisms>` added to the system, along with any

            a list of prediction processes added to the system, each comprised of one of its `ORIGIN` mechanisms
            and the associated `prediction mechanism <EVCMechanism_Prediction_Mechanisms>`.
    COMMENT

    prediction_mechanism_type : ProcessingMechanism : default IntegratorMechanism
        the `ProcessingMechanism` class used for `prediction mechanism(s) <EVCMechanism_Prediction_Mechanisms>`.
        Each instance is named based on `ORIGIN` mechanism + PREDICTION_MECHANISM,
        and assigned an `outputState <OutputState>` with a name based on the same

    prediction_mechanism_params : Dict[param key, param value] : default None
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` passed to `prediction_mechanism_type` when

            array with the `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` of each
            `prediction mechanism <EVCMechanism_Prediction_Mechanisms>` listed in `prediction_mechanisms`.  Each item of
            axis 0 corresponds to the `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` of a prediction mechanism,
            axis 1 an `inputState <InputState>` of that prediction mechanism, and
            axis 2 the elements of the input for that inputState.
    COMMENT

        value the `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` of the corresponding prediction mechanism.

    monitoring_mechanism : ObjectiveMechanism
        the 'ObjectiveMechanism' that monitors the mechanisms and/or outputStates used by the EVCMechanism to evaluate
        the system's performance.  Each mechanism and/or outputState listed in the EVCMechanism's
        `monitored_output_states` attribute projects to an inputState of the `monitoring_mechanism`.  The EVCMechanism's
        `outcome_function` is assiged as the `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>` for `monitoring_mechanism`.
        Its result is provided by a projection from the `monitoring_mechanism` to the EVCMechanism.

    monitored_output_states : List[OutputState]
        each item is an outputState of a mechanism in the system that has been assigned a projection to a corresponding
        inputState of the EVCMechanism.

    COMMENT:
    [TBI]
        monitored_values : 3D np.array
            an array of values of the outputStates in `monitored_output_states` (equivalent to the values of
            the EVCMechanism's `input_states <EVCMechanism.input_states>`).
    COMMENT

    monitor_for_control_weights_and_exponents: List[Tuple[scalar, scalar]]
        a list of tuples, each of which contains the weight and exponent (in that order) for an outputState in
        `monitored_outputStates`, listed in the same order as the outputStates are listed in `monitored_outputStates`.

    function : function : default ControlSignalGridSearch
        determines the `allocation_policy <EVCMechanism.allocation_policy>` to use for the next round of the system's
        execution. The default function, `ControlSignalGridSearch`, conducts an exhaustive (*grid*) search of all
        combinations of the `allocation_samples` of its ControlSignals (and contained in its
        `control_signal_search_space` attribute), by executing the system (using `run_simulation`) for each
        combination, evaluating the result using `value_function`, and returning the allocation_policy that generated
        the highest value.  If a custom function is specified, it must accommodate a :keyword:`controller` argument that
        specifies an EVCMechanism (and provides access to its attributes, including `control_signal_search_space`),
        and must return an array with the same format (number and type of elements) as the EVCMechanism's
        `allocation_policy` attribute.

    COMMENT

    allocation_policy : 2d np.array : defaultControlAllocation
        determines the value assigned as the `variable <ControlSignal.variable>` for each `ControlSignal` and its
        associated `ControlProjection`.  Each item of the array must be a 1d array (usually containing a scalar)
        that specifies an `allocation` for the corresponding ControlSignal, and the number of items must equal the
        number of ControlSignals in the EVCMechanism's `control_signals` attribute.

    value_function : function : default value_function()
        calculates the value for a given `allocation_policy`.  The default uses `outcome_function` to determine the
        outcome of the policy, `cost_function` to determine its cost, combines these using
        `combine_outcome_and_cost_function`, and returns the result as the first item of a three-item tuple, the second
        and third of which are the outcome and cost used to determine the result.  The default function can be
        replaced by any function that returns a tuple with three items: the calculated EVC (which must be a scalar
        value), and the outcome and cost from which it was calculated (these can be scalar values or `None`).
        If used with the EVCMechanism's default `function <EVCMechanism.function>`, a custom `value_function` must
        accommodate three arguments (passed by name): a :keyword:`controller` argument that is the EVCMechanism for
        which it is carrying out the calculation; an :keyword:`outcome` argument that is a scalar value that reflects
        the outcome of the function of the ObjectiveMechanism (based on the value of the outputStates being monitored
        (and specified in the EVCMechanism's `monitored_output_states` attribute;
        and a :keyword:`costs` argument that is a 2d array of costs, each item of which is the `cost` of a
        ControlSignal in the EVCMechanism's `control_signals` attribute.  A custom function assigned to
        `value_function` can also call any of the other EVCMechanism functions described below (however,
        see `note <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` above).

    outcome_function : function : default LinearCombination(operation=PRODUCT)
        calculates the outcome for a given `allocation_policy`.  The default combines the values of the outputStates in
        `monitored_output_states` by taking their product, using the `LinearCombination` function.  The
        `weights and/or exponents specified for the outputStates <ControlMechanism_OutputState_Tuple>` (see
        examples <EVCMechanism_Examples>`) are used as the `weights` and `exponents` parameters of the
        `LinearCombination` function, respectively. If the default `outcome_function` is called by a custom
        `value_function`, the weights and/or exponents can be specified as 1d arrays in a `WEIGHTS` and/or `EXPONENTS`
        entry of a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` specified for the `params` argument of
        the `LinearCombination` function. The length of each array must equal the number of (and values be listed in
        the same order as) the outputStates in the EVCMechanism's `monitored_output_states` attribute.  These
        specifications will supercede any made for individual outputStates in the `monitor_for_control` argument or
        `MONITOR_FOR_CONTROL <monitor_for_control>` entry of a parameter specification dictionary for the
        EVCMechanism (see `ControlMechanism_Monitored_OutputStates`).  The default function can also be replaced
        with any `custom function <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` that returns a scalar value.  If
        used with the EVCMechanism's default `value_function`, a custom outcome_function must accommodate two
        arguments (passed by name): a :keyword:`controller` argument that is the EVCMechanism itself (and can be used
        access to its attributes, including the `monitor_for_control_weights_and_exponents` attribute that lists the
        weights and exponents assigned to each outputState being monitored);  and an :keyword:`outcome` argument,
        that is a scalar value specifying the result of the ObjectiveMechanism's function (based on the outputStates
        listed in the `monitored_output_states` attribute of the :keyword:`controller` argument).

    cost_function : function : default LinearCombination(operation=SUM)
        calculates the cost for a given `allocation_policy`.  The default combines the `cost` of each ControlSignals in
        `control_signals` by summing them using the `LinearCombination` function. If the default `cost_function` is
        called by a custom `value_function`, the weights and/or exponents parameters of the function can be used,
        respectively, to scale and/or exponentiate the contribution of each ControlSignal's cost to the aggregated
        value.  These must be specified as 1d arrays in a `WEIGHTS` and/or `EXPONENTS` entry of a
        `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` specified for the `params` argument of the
        `LinearCombination` function; the length of each array must equal the number of (and the values listed in the
        same order as) the ControlSignals in the EVCMechanism's `control_signals` attribute, and be in the same order.
        The default function can also be replaced with any
        `custom function <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` that returns a scalar value.  If used with
        the EVCMechanism's default `value_function`, a custom cost_function must accommodate two arguments (passed by
        name): a :keyword:`controller` argument that is the EVCMechanism itself;  and a
        :keyword:`costs` argument, that is 1d array of scalar values specifying the `cost` for each ControlSignal listed
        in the `control_signals` attribute of the :keyword:`controller` argument.

    combine_outcome_and_cost_function : function : default LinearCombination(operation=SUM)
        combines the outcome and cost for given `allocation_policy` to determine its value.  The default uses the
        `LinearCombination` function to subtract the cost from the outcome, and returns the difference.  If the
        default `combine_outcome_and_cost_function` is called by a custom `value_function`, the weights and/or
        exponents parameters of the `LinearCombination` function can be used, respectively, to scale and/or exponentiate
        the contribution of the outcome and/or cost to the result.  These must be specified as 1d arrays in a `WEIGHTS`
        and/or EXPONENTS entry of a  `parameter specifiction dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>`
        assigned to the function's `params` argument; each array must have two elements, the first for the outcome
        and second for the cost. The default function can also be replaced with any
        `custom function <EVCMechanism_Calling_and_Assigning_Functions>` that returns a scalar value.  If used with
        the EVCMechanism's default `value_function`, a custom combine_outcome_and_cost_function must accomoudate three
        arguments (passed by name): a :keyword:`controller` argument that is the EVCMechanism itself; an
        :keyword:`outcome` argument that is a 1d array with the outcome of the current `allocation_policy`; and a
        :keyword:`cost` argument that is 1d array with the cost of the current `allocation_policy`.

    control_signal_search_space : 2d np.array
        an array that contains arrays of allocation policies.  Each allocation policy contains one value for each of
        the mechanism's ControlSignals.  By default, it is assigned a set of all possible allocation policies
        (using np.meshgrid to construct all permutations of ControlSignal values).

    EVC_max : 1d np.array with single value
        the maximum EVC value over all allocation policies in `control_signal_search_space`.

    EVC_max_state_values : 2d np.array
        an array of the values for the outputStates in `monitored_output_states` using the allocation policy that
        generated `EVC_max`.

    EVC_max_policy : 1d np.array
        an array of the ControlSignal intensity values for the allocation policy that generated `EVC_max`.

    save_all_values_and_policies : bool : default False
        specifies whether or not to save all allocation policies and associated EVC values (in addition to the max).
        If it is specified, each policy tested in the `control_signal_search_space` is saved in `EVC_policies` and their
        values are saved in `EVC_values`.

    EVC_policies : 2d np.array
        array of allocation policies tested in `control_signal_search_space`.  The values of each are stored in
        `EVC_values`.

    EVC_values :  1d np.array
        array of EVC values corresponding to the policies in `EVC_policies`.
