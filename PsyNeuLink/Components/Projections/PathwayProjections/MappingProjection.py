.. _Mapping_Overview:

Overview
--------

A MappingProjection transmits the `value <OutputState.value>` of an `OutputState` of one `ProcessingMechanism` (its
`sender <MappingProjection.sender>`) to the `InputState` of another (its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`).
The default `function <MappingProjection.function>` for a MappingProjection is  `LinearMatrix`, which uses the
MappingProjection's `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` attribute to transform the value received from its `sender
<MappingProjection.sender>` and provide the result to its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`.

.. _Mapping_Creation:

Creating a MappingProjection
-----------------------------

A MappingProjection can be created in any of the ways that can be used to create a `Projection <Projection_Creation>`
(see `Projection_Sender` and `Projection_Receiver` for specifying its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and
`receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` attributes, respectively).

MappingProjections are also generated automatically in the following circumstances, using a value for its `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter appropriate to the circumstance:

  * by a `Process`, when two adjacent `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` in its `pathway <Process_Base.pathway>` do not already
    have a Projection assigned between them (`AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX` is used as the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
    specification, which determines the appropriate matrix by context);
  ..
  * by an `ObjectiveMechanism`, from each `OutputState` listed in its `monitored_values
    <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_values>` attribute to the corresponding `InputState` of the ObjectiveMechanism
    (`AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX` is used as the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` specification, which determines the
    appropriate matrix by context);
  ..
  * by a `LearningMechanism`, between it and the other components required to implement learning
    (see `LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations` for details);
  ..
  * by a `ControlMechanism`, from the `ObjectiveMechanism` that `it creates <_ControlMechanism_Monitored_OutputStates>`
    to its *ERROR_SIGNAL* ``, and from the `OutputStates <OutputState>` listed in the ControlMechanism's
    `monitored_output_states <ControlMechanism_Base.monitored_output_states>` attribute) to the ObjectiveMechanism (as
     described above; an `IDENTITY_MATRIX` is used for all of these).

.. _Mapping_Matrix_Specification:

Specifying the Matrix Parameter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a MappingProjection is created explicitly, the **matrix** argument of its constructor can be used to specify
its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter.  This is used by the MappingProjection's `function
<MappingProjection.function>` to transform the input from its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` into the `value
<MappingProjection.value>` provided to its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`. It can be specified in any of the
following ways:

  * **List, array or matrix**  -- if it is a list, each item must be a list or 1d np.array of numbers;  otherwise,
    it must be a 2d np.array or np.matrix.  In each case, the outer dimension (outer list items, array axis 0,
    or matrix rows) corresponds to the elements of the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>`, and the inner dimension
    (inner list items, array axis 1, or matrix columns) corresponds to the weighting of the contribution that a
    given `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` makes to the `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` (the number of which
    must match the length of the receiver's `variable <InputState.variable>`).

  .. _Matrix_Keywords:

  * **Matrix keyword** -- used to specify a standard type of matrix without having to specify its individual
    values, or to allow the type of matrix to be determined by context;  any of the `matrix keywords
    <Keywords.MatrixKeywords>` can be used.

  ..
  * **Random matrix function** (`random_matrix <Utilities.random_matrix>`) -- a convenience function
    that provides more flexibility than `RANDOM_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX`.  It generates a random matrix sized for a
    **sender** and **receiver**, with random numbers drawn from a uniform distribution within a specified **range** and
    with a specified **offset**.

  .. _MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification:

  * **Tuple** -- used to specify the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` along with a specification for learning;
    The tuple must have two items: the first can be any of the specifications described above; the second must be
    a specification for `LearningProjection`, using either the keywords *LEARNING_PROJECTION*, *LEARNING*, or a
    reference to the class (in which case a default LearningProjection is created), or an existing LearningProjection.


.. _MappingProjection_Learning_Specification:

Specifying Learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of a MappingProjection can be specified for learning by assigning it
a `LearningProjection` (see LearningMechanism documentation for an overview of `learning components
<LearningMechanism_Overview>` and a detailed description of `LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations`;  see
`MappingProjection_Learning` below for a description of how learning modifies a MappingProjection).  A
LearningProjection can be assigned to a MappingProjection in any of the following ways:

    * in the **matrix** argument of the MappingProjection's constructor, using the `tuple format
      <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>` described above;
    ..
    * by specifying the MappingProjection (or its *MATRIX* `ParameterState`) as the `receiver
      <LearningProjection.receiver>` of a `LearningProjection`;
    ..
    * specifying the the MappingProjection (or its *MATRIX* `ParameterState`) in the **learning_signals** argument of
      the constructor for a `LearningMechanism <LearningSignal_Specification>`.
    ..
    * by `specifying learning <Process_Learning>` for a `Process`, which assigns `LearningProjections
      <LearningProjection>` to all of the  MappingProjections in the Process' `pathway <Process_Base.pathway>`;


.. _MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization:

Deferred Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a MappingProjection is created, its full initialization is `deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its
`sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This
allows a MappingProjection to be created before its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and/or `receiver
<MappingProjection.receiver>` have been created (e.g., before them in a script), by calling its constructor without
specifying its **sender** or **receiver** arguments. However, for the MappingProjection to be operational,
initialization must be completed by calling its `deferred_init` method.  This is not necessary if the MappingProjection
is specified in the `pathway <Process_Base.pathway>` of `Process`, or anywhere else that its `sender
<MappingProjection.sender>` and receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` can be determined by context.

.. _Mapping_Structure:

Structure
---------

In addition to its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>`, `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`, and `function
<MappingProjection.function>`, a MappingProjection has two characteristic attributes:

.. _Mapping_Matrix:

* `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter - used by the MappingProjection's `function
  <MappingProjection.function>` to carry out a matrix transformation of its input, that is then provided to its
  `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`. It can be specified in a variety of ways, as described `above
  <Mapping_Matrix_Specification>`.

.. _Mapping_Matrix_ParameterState:

* *MATRIX* `ParameterState` - this receives any `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` that are assigned to the
  MappingProjection (see `MappingProjection_Learning_Specification` above), and updates the current value of the
  MappingProjection's `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter in response to `learning
  <LearningMechanism>`.  The `function <ParameterState.function>` of a *MATRIX* ParameterState is an
  `AccumulatorIntegrator`, which accumulates the weight changes received from the LearningProjections
  that project to it (see `MappingProjection_Learning` below).  This can be replaced by any function that can take
  as its input an array or matrix, and return one of the same size.

.. _Mapping_Execution:

Execution
---------

A MappingProjection uses its `function <MappingProjection.function>` and `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
parameter to transform its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` into a form suitable for the `variable
<InputState.variable>` of its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`.  A MappingProjection cannot be executed
directly. It is executed when the `InputState` to which it projects (i.e., its `receiver
<MappingProjection.receiver>`) is updated;  that occurs when the InputState's owner `Mechanism` is executed.
When executed, the MappingProjection's *MATRIX* `ParameterState` updates its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
parameter based on any `LearningProjection(s)` it receives (listed in the ParameterState's `mod_afferents
<ParameterState.mod_afferents>` attribute). This brings into effect any changes that occurred due to `learning
<MappingProjection_Learning>`.  Since this does not occur until the Mechanism that receives the MappingProjection
is executed (in accord with :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>`), any changes due to learning do not take effect, and are not
observable (e.g., through inspection of the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` attribute or the
`value <ParameterState.value>` of its ParameterState) until the next `TRIAL` of execution (see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation`
for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

.. _MappingProjection_Learning:

Learning
~~~~~~~~

Learning modifies the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of a MappingProjection, under the influence
of one or more `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` that project to its *MATRIX* `ParameterState`.
This conforms to the general procedures for modulation used by `ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>`
A LearningProjection `modulates <LearningSignal_Modulation>` the `function <ParameterState.function>` of the
*MATRIX* ParameterState, which is responsible for keeping a record of the value of the MappingProjection's matrix,
and providing it to the MappingProjection's `function <MappingProjection.function>` (usually `LinearMatrix`).  By
default, the function for the *MATRIX* ParameterState is an `AccumulatorIntegrator`.  A LearningProjection
modulates it by assigning the value of its `additive_param <AccumulatorIntegrator.additive_param>` (`increment
<AccumulatorIntegrator.increment>`), which is added to its `previous_value <AccumulatorIntegrator.previous_value>`
attribute each time it is executed. The result is that each time the MappingProjection is executed, and in turn
executes its *MATRIX* ParameterState, the `weight changes <LearningProjection_Structure>` conveyed to the
MappingProjection from any LearningProjection(s) are added to the record of the matrix kept by the *MATRIX*
ParameterState's `AccumulatorIntegrator` function in its `previous_value <AccumulatorIntegrator.previous_value>`
attribute. This is then the value of the matrix used  by the MappingProjection's `LinearMatrix` function when it is
executed.  It is important to note that the accumulated weight changes received by a MappingProjection from its
LearningProjection(s) are stored by the *MATRIX* ParameterState's function, and not the MappingProjection's `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter itself; the latter stores the original value of the matrix before learning (that
is, its unmodulated value, conforming to the general protocol for `modulation <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` in
PsyNeuLink).  The most recent value of the matrix used by the MappingProjection is stored in the `value
<ParameterState.value>` of its *MATRIX* ParameterState. As noted `above <Mapping_Execution>`, however, this does not
reflect any changes due to learning on the current `TRIAL` of execution; those are assigned to the ParameterState's
`value <ParameterState.value>` when it executes, which does not occur until the `Mechanism` that receives the
MappingProjection is executed in the next `TRIAL` of execution.

    Implements a Projection that transmits the output of one Mechanism to the input of another.


    COMMENT:
        Description:
            The MappingProjection class is a type in the Projection category of Component.
            It implements a Projection that takes the value of an OutputState of one Mechanism, transforms it as
            necessary, and provides it to the inputState of another ProcessingMechanism.
            It's function conveys (and possibly transforms) the OutputState.value of a sender
                to the InputState.value of a receiver.

            IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
                AUGMENT SO THAT SENDER CAN BE A Mechanism WITH MULTIPLE OUTPUT STATES, IN WHICH CASE:
                    RECEIVER MUST EITHER BE A MECHANISM WITH SAME NUMBER OF INPUT STATES AS SENDER HAS OUTPUTSTATES
                        (FOR WHICH SENDER OUTPUTSTATE IS MAPPED TO THE CORRESPONDING RECEIVER INPUT STATE
                            USING THE SAME MAPPING_PROJECTION MATRIX, OR AN ARRAY OF THEM)
                    OR BOTH MUST BE 1D ARRAYS (I.E., SINGLE VECTOR)

    Arguments
    ---------

    sender : Optional[OutputState or Mechanism]
        specifies the source of the Projection's input. If a `Mechanism` is specified, its
        `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` will be used. If it is not specified, it will be assigned in
        the context in which the Projection is used, or its initialization will be `deferred
        <MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    receiver: Optional[InputState or Mechanism]
        specifies the destination of the Projection's output.  If a `Mechanism` is specified, its
        `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>` will be used. If it is not specified, it will be assigned in
        the context in which the Projection is used, or its initialization will be `deferred
        <MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    matrix : list, np.ndarray, np.matrix, function or keyword : default DEFAULT_MATRIX

        override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default MappingProjection-<index>
        a string used for the name of the MappingProjection.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by `ProjectionRegistry`

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the MappingProjection.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py

    value : ndarray
        output of MappingProjection, transmitted to `variable <InputState.variable>` of its `receiver
        <MappingProjection.receiver>`.

    name : str : default MappingProjection-<index>
        the name of the MappingProjection.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the Projection;
