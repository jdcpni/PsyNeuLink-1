.. _ControlProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A ControlProjection is a subclass of `ModulatoryProjection` that projects to the `ParameterState <ParameterState>` of
a `ProcessingMechanism`. It takes the value of a `ControlSignal` of a `ControlMechanism` and uses it to  modify the
value of the parameter associated with the ParameterState to which it projects.  All of the ControlProjections in a
System, along with its other `control components <ControlMechanism>`, can be displayed using the System's `show_graph`
method with its **show_control** argument assigned as `True`.

.. _ControlProjection_Creation:

Creating a ControlProjection
----------------------------

A ControlProjection can be created using any of the standard ways to `create a Projection <Projection_Creation>`,
or by including it in a tuple that `specifies a parameter <ParameterState_Specification>` for a `Mechanism`,
`MappingProjection`, or the `function <Component.function>` of either of these.  If a ControlProjection is created
using its constructor on its own, the `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` argument must be specified.  If it is
included in a parameter specification, the ParameterState for the parameter being specified will be assigned as the
ControlProjection's `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`.  If its `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` is not
specified, its assignment depends on the `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`.  If the receiver belongs to a
Mechanism that is part of a System, then the ControlProjection's `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` is assigned to a
`ControlSignal` of the System's `controller`.

.. _ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization:

Deferred Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a ControlProjection is created, its full initialization is :ref:`deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its
`sender <ControlProjection.sender>` and `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This allows
a ControlProjection to be created before its `sender` (and/or `receiver`) have been created (e.g., before them in a
script), by calling its constructor without specifying its **sender** or **receiver** arguments. However, for the
ControlProjection to be operational, initialization must be completed by calling its `deferred_init` method.  This is
not necessary if the parameter(s) to be controlled are specified in the **control_signals** argument of a `System`, or
in a tuple specifying the parameter of a `Mechanism` (or its `function <Mechanism.function`) that is part of a System
-- in those cases, deferred initialization is completed automatically.

.. _ControlProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

The `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` of a ControlProjection is a `ControlSignal` of a `ControlMechanism`.  Its
`receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` is the `ParameterState` of a `Mechanism` or `MappingProjection`, that is
associated with a parameter of the ParameterState's owner or its owner's `function <Component.function>`.  The
`function <ControlProjection.function>` of a ControlProjection is, by default, the identity function;  that is,
it conveys the `value <ControlSignal.value>` of its `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` to
its `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`, for use in modifying the value of the parameter that it controls.

.. _ControlProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A ControlProjection cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the `ParameterState` to which it projects is
updated.  Note that this only occurs when the ProcessingMechanism to which the `ParameterState` belongs is executed
(see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating). When a ControlProjection is executed, its
`function <ControlProjection.function>` assigns the value of the `ControlSignal` from which it projects as its own
`value <ControlProjection.value>`. This is used by the `ParameterState` to which the ControlProjection projects to
modify the parameter for which it is responsible.

.. note::
   The changes in a parameter in response to the execution of a ControlProjection are not applied until the
   Mechanism that receives the Projection are next executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation` for an explanation of "lazy"
   updating).

    COMMENT:
        Description:
            The ControlProjection class is a type in the Projection category of Component.
            It implements a projection to the ParameterState of a mechanism that modifies a parameter of its function.
            It:
               - takes a scalar as its input (sometimes referred to as an "allocation")
               - uses its `function` to compute its value (sometimes referred to as its "intensity"
                 based on its input (allocation) its `sender`,
               - used to modify a parameter of the owner of the `receiver` or its `function`.

        ** MOVE:
        ProjectionRegistry:
            All ControlProjections are registered in ProjectionRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,

    COMMENT


    Arguments
    ---------

    sender : Optional[Mechanism or OutputState]
        specifies the source of the input for the ControlProjection;  usually an `OutputState <OutputState>` of a
        `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`, and commonly the `ControlSignal` of an `EVCMechanism`.  If it is not
        specified, the ControlProjection will
        COMMENT:
        remain in DEFER_INITIALIZATION status, and will
        COMMENT
        be ignored during execution.

    receiver : Optional[Mechanism or ParameterState]
        specifies the ParameterState associated with the parameter to be controlled.  This must be specified,
        or be able to be determined by the context in which the ControlProjection is created or assigned.

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear
        specifies the function used to convert the :keyword:`value` of the ControlProjection's
        `sender <ControlProjection.sender>`  to its own `value <ControlProjection.value>`.

    control_signal_params : Dict[param keyword, param value]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the `ControlSignal` that is the sender of the Projection (see `ControlSignal_Structure` for a description
        of ControlSignal parameters).

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the Projection, its `function <ControlProjection.function>`, and/or a custom function and its parameters.
        Values specified for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the
        constructor.

    name : str : default ControlProjection-<index>
        a string used for the name of the ControlProjection.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the ControlProjection.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in ``__init__.py``
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).

    Attributes
    ----------

    componentType : CONTROL_PROJECTION

    sender : OutputState of ControlMechanism
        mechanism that provides the current input for the ControlProjection (usually a
        `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`).

    receiver : ParameterState of Mechanism
        :doc:`parameterState <ParameterState>` for the parameter to be modified by the ControlProjection.

    allocation : 1d np.array
        the input to the ControlProjection; same as the :keyword:`value` of the `sender <ControlProjection.sender>`.

    value : float
        during initialization, assigned a keyword string (either `INITIALIZING` or `DEFERRED_INITIALIZATION`);
        during execution, is assigned the current value of the ControlProjection.

    name : str : default ControlProjection-<index>
        the name of the ControlProjection.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the Projection;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for Projection.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the Projection;
        if it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in ``__init__.py``
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
