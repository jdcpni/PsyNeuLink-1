.. _ControlProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A ControlProjection is a type of `ModulatoryProjection` that projects to the `ParameterState <ParameterState>` of
a `ProcessingMechanism`. It takes the `value <ControlSignal.value>` of a `ControlSignal` of a `ControlMechanism` and
uses it to  modify the value of the parameter associated with the ParameterState to which it projects.  All of the
ControlProjections in a System, along with its other `control components <ControlMechanism>`, can be displayed using
the System's `show_graph` method with its **show_control** argument assigned as `True`.

.. _ControlProjection_Creation:

Creating a ControlProjection
----------------------------

A ControlProjection can be created using any of the standard ways to `create a Projection <Projection_Creation>`,
or by including it in a `tuple <ParameterState_Tuple_Specification>` that specifies a parameter for a `Mechanism`,
`MappingProjection`, or the `function <Component.function>` of either of these.  If a ControlProjection is created
explicitly (using its constructor), and its **receiver** argument is not specified, its initialization is `deferred
<ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.  If it is included in a parameter specification, the `ParameterState`
for the parameter being specified will be assigned as the ControlProjection's `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`.
If its **sender** argument is not specified, its assignment depends on the **receiver**.  If the **receiver** belongs
to a Mechanism that is part of a `System`, then the ControlProjection's  `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` is
assigned to a `ControlSignal` of the System's `controller`.  Otherwise, its initialization is `deferred
<ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

.. _ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization:

Deferred Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a ControlProjection is created, its full initialization is `deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its
`sender <ControlProjection.sender>` and `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This allows
a ControlProjection to be created before its `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` and/or `receiver
<ControlProjection.receiver>` have been created (e.g., before them in a script), by calling its constructor without
specifying its **sender** or **receiver** arguments. However, for the ControlProjection to be operational,
initialization must be completed by calling its `deferred_init` method. This is not necessary if the ControlProjection
is included in a `tuple specification <ParameterState_Tuple_Specification>` for the parameter of a `Mechanism` or its
`function <Mechanism_Base.function>`, in which case the deferred initialization is completed automatically when the
`ControlMechanism` is created for the `System` to which the parameter's owner belongs (see `ControlMechanism_Creation`).


.. _ControlProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

The `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` of a ControlProjection is a `ControlSignal` of a `ControlMechanism`.
The `value <ControlSignal.value>` of the `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` is used by the ControlProjection as its
`variable <ControlProjection.variable>`;  this is also assigned to its `control_signal
<ControlProjection.control_signal>` attribute, and serves as the input to the ControlProjection's `function
<ControlProjection.function>`.  The default `function <ControlProjection.function>` for a
ControlProjection is an identity function (`Linear` with **slope**\\ =1 and **intercept**\\ =0);  that is, it simply
conveys the value of its `control_signal <ControlProjection.control_signal>` to its `receiver
<ControlProjection.receiver>`, for use in modifying the value of the parameter that it controls. Its `receiver
<ControlProjection.receiver>` is the `ParameterState` for the parameter of the `Mechanism` or its `function
<Mechanism_Base.function>` that is controlled by the ControlProjection.

.. _ControlProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A ControlProjection cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the `ParameterState` to which it projects is
updated.  Note that this only occurs when the `Mechanism` to which the `ParameterState` belongs is executed
(see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating). When a ControlProjection is executed, its
`function <ControlProjection.function>` gets the `control_signal <ControlProjection.control_signal>` from its `sender
<ControlProjection.sender>` and conveys that to its `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`.  This is used by the
`receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` to modify the parameter controlled by the ControlProjection (see
`ModulatorySignal_Modulation` and `ParameterState Execution <ParameterState_Execution>` for how modulation operates and
how this applies to a ParameterState).

.. note::
   The changes to a parameter in response to the execution of a ControlProjection are not applied until the
   `Mechanism` that receives the ControlProjection are next executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation` for an explanation of
   "lazy" updating).

    COMMENT:
        Description:
            The ControlProjection class is a type in the Projection category of Component.
            It implements a projection to the ParameterState of a Mechanism that modifies a parameter of its function.
            It:
               - takes a scalar as its input (sometimes referred to as an "allocation")
               - uses its `function` to compute its value (sometimes referred to as its "intensity"
                 based on its input (allocation) its `sender`,
               - used to modify a parameter of the owner of the `receiver` or its `function`.

        ** MOVE:
        ProjectionRegistry:
            All ControlProjections are registered in ProjectionRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,

        `deferred <ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    receiver : Optional[Mechanism or ParameterState]
        specifies the `ParameterState` associated with the parameter to be controlled; if it is not specified,
        and cannot be `inferred from context <ControlProjection_Creation>`, initialization is `deferred
        <ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0)
        specifies the function used to convert the `control_signal <ControlProjection.control_signal>` to the
        ControlProjection's `value <ControlProjection.value>`.

    control_signal_params : Dict[param keyword, param value]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        ControlProjection's `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` (see `ControlSignal_Structure` for a description
        of ControlSignal parameters).

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the Projection, its `function <ControlProjection.function>`, and/or a custom function and its parameters.
        Values specified for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the
        constructor.

    name : str : default ControlProjection-<index>
        a string used for the name of the ControlProjection.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the ControlProjection.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in ``__init__.py``
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).

    Attributes
    ----------

    componentType : CONTROL_PROJECTION

    sender : ControlSignal
        source of the `control_signal <ControlProjection.control_signal>`.

    function : Function
        assigns the `control_signal` received from the `sender <ControlProjection.sender>` to the
        ControlProjection's `value <ControlProjection.value>`; the default in an identity function.

    value : float
        the value used to modify the parameter controlled by the ControlProjection (see `ModulatorySignal_Modulation`
        and `ParameterState Execution <ParameterState_Execution>` for how modulation operates and how this applies
        to a ParameterState).

    name : str : default ControlProjection-<index>
        the name of the ControlProjection.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the Projection;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).
