.. _LearningProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A LearningProjection is a type of `ModulatoryProjection` that projects from a `LearningMechanism` to the
*MATRIX* `ParameterState` of a `MappingProjection`.  It takes the `value <LearningSignal.value>` of a `LearningSignal`
of a `LearningMechanism`, and uses it to modify the value of the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
parameter of that MappingProjection.  All of the LearningProjections in a System, along with its other `learning
components <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>`, can be displayed using the System's `show_graph` method with
its **show_learning** argument assigned as `True`.

.. _LearningProjection_Creation:

Creating a LearningProjection
------------------------------------

A LearningProjection can be created using any of the standard ways to `create a Projection <Projection_Creation>`,
or by including it in a `tuple <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>` that specifies the `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of a `MappingProjection`.  LearningProjections are also created automatically,
along with the other `Components required for learning <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>`, when learning is
specified for a `Process <Process_Learning>` or a `System <System_Execution_Learning>`.

If a LearningProjection is created explicitly (using its constructor), and its **receiver** argument is not specified,
its initialization is `deferred <LearningProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.  If it is included in the `matrix
specification <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>` for a `MappingProjection`, the *MATRIX* `ParameterState` for
the MappingProjection will be assigned as the LearningProjection's `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`.  If its
**sender** argument is not specified, its assignment depends on the **receiver**.  If the **receiver** belongs to a
MappingProjection that projects between two Mechanisms that are both in the same `Process <Process_Learning>` or
`System <System_Execution_Learning>`, then the LearningProjection's `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` is assigned
to a `LearningSignal` of the `LearningMechanism` for the MappingProjection. If there is none, it is `created
<LearningMechanism_Creation>` along with any other components needed to implement learning for the MappingProjection
(see `LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations`). Otherwise, the LearningProjection's initialization is `deferred
<LearningProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

.. _LearningProjection_Deferred_Initialization:

Deferred Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a LearningProjection is created, its full initialization is `deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its
`sender <LearningProjection.sender>` and `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This
allows a LearningProjection to be created before its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` and/or `receiver
<LearningProjection.receiver>` have been created (e.g., before them in a script), by calling its constructor without
specifying its **sender** or **receiver** arguments. However, for the LearningProjection to be operational,
initialization must be completed by calling its `deferred_init` method.  This is not necessary if the
LearningProjection is included in a `tuple specification <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>` for the `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of a `MappingProjection`, in which case deferred initialization is completed
automatically when the `LearningMechanism` associated with that MappingProjection is created for the `Process` or
`System` to which it belongs (see `LearningMechanism_Creation`).

.. _LearningProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

.. _LearningProjection_Sender:

Sender
~~~~~~

The `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` of a LearningProjection is a `LearningSignal` of a `LearningMechanism`,
The `value <LearningSignal.value>` of the `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` -- a matrix of weight changes --
is used by the LearningProjection as its `variable <LearningProjection.variable>`;  this is also assigned to its
`learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>` attribute, and serves as the input to the LearningProjection's
`function <LearningProjection.function>`.

.. _LearningProjection_Function_and_Learning_Rate:

Function and learning_rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default `function <LearningProjection.function>` of a LearningProjection is an identity function (`Linear` with
**slope**\\ =1 and **intercept**\\ =0).  However, its result can be modified by the LearningProjection's `learning_rate
<LearningProjection.learning_rate>` parameter (specified in the **learning_rate** argument of its constructor).
If specified, it is applied multiplicatively to the output of the LearningProjection's `function
<LearningProjection.function>`, and the result is assigned to the LearningProjection's `value
<LearningProjection.value>` and `weight_change_matrix <LearningProjection.weight_change_matrix>` attributes.  Thus,
the LearningProjection's `learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` parameter can be used to modulate the the
`learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>` it receives, in addition to (and on top of) the effects of the
`learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` for the `LearningMechanism` from which it receives the
`learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>`. Specification of the `learning_rate
<LearningProjection.learning_rate>` for a LearningProjection supersedes any specification(s) of the
:keyword:`learning_rate` for any `Process <Process_Learning` and/or `System <System_Learning>` to which the
LearningMechanism from which it projects belongs (see `learning_rate <LearningMechanism_Learning_Rate>` for additional
details).  However, its `learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` can be specified by the `LearningSignal
<LearningSignal_Learning_Rate>` that is its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>`;  that specification takes precedence
over the direct specification of the `learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` for the LearningProjection
(i.e., in the **learning_rate** argument of its constructor, or by direct assignment of a value to the attribute).  If a
`learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` is not specified for the LearningProjection, then the result of its
`function <LearningProjection.function>` is assigned unmodified as the LearningProjection's `value
<LearningProjection.value>` (and `weight_change_matrix <LearningProjection.weight_change_matrix>` attributes.

.. _LearningProjection_Receiver:

Receiver
~~~~~~~~

The `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>` of a LearningProject is the *MATRIX* `ParameterState` of a
`MappingProjection`, that uses the `weight_change_matrix <LearningProjection.weight_change_matrix>` provided by the
LearningProjection to modify the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `MappingProjection` being
learned.

.. _LearningProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A LearningProjection cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the *MATRIX* ParameterState to which it
projects is updated.  This occurs when the `learned_projection <LearningProjection.learned_projection>` (the
`MappingProjection` to which the *MATRIX* ParameterState belongs) is updated. Note that these events occur only
when the ProcessingMechanism that receives the `learned_projection <LearningProjection.learned_projection>` is
executed (see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating). When the LearningProjection is
executed, its `function <LearningProjection.function>` gets the `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>`
from its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` and conveys that to its `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`,
possibly modified by a `learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` if that is specified for it or its `sender
<LearningProjection.sender>` (see `above <LearningProjection_Function_and_Learning_Rate>`).

.. note::
   The changes to the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of a `MappingProjection` in response to the
   execution of a LearningProjection are not applied until the `Mechanism` that receives MappingProjection are
   next executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

    Arguments
    ---------

    sender : Optional[LearningMechanism or LearningSignal]
        specifies the source of the `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>` for the LearningProjection;
        if it is not specified, and cannot be `inferred from context <LearningProjection_Creation>`, initialization is
        `deferred <LearningProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    receiver : Optional[MappingProjection or ParameterState for matrix parameter of one]
        specifies the *MATRIX* `ParameterState` (or the `MappingProjection` that owns it) for the `matrix
        <MappingProjection.matrix>` of the `learned_projection <LearningProjection.learned_projection>` to be
        modified by the LearningProjection; if it is not specified, and cannot be `inferred from context
        <LearningProjection_Creation>`, initialization is `deferred <LearningProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0)
        specifies the function used to convert the `learning_signal` to the `weight_change_matrix
        <LearningProjection.weight_change_matrix>`, prior to applying the `learning_rate
        <LearningProjection.learning_rate>`.

    learning_function : Optional[LearningFunction or function] : default BackPropagation
        specifies a function to be used for learning by the `LearningMechanism` to which the
        LearningProjection's `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` belongs.

        .. note::
           the **learning_function** argument is implemented to preserve backward compatibility with previous versions;
           its use is not advised.

    learning_rate : Optional[float or int]
        if specified, it is applied multiplicatively to the `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>`
        received from the `sender <LearningProjection.sender>`; specification of the `learning_rate
        <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` for a LearningProjection supersedes any specification(s) of the
        :keyword:`learning_rate` for any `Process <Process_Learning>` and/or `System <System_Learning>` to which the
        LearningProjection belongs, and is applied in addition to any effects of the `learning_rate
        <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` for the `LearningMechanism` from which the LearningProjection receives its
        `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>` (see `LearningProjection_Function_and_Learning_Rate` for
        additional details).

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that specifies the parameters for the
        Projection, its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters. By default, it contains an entry for
        the Projection's default `function <LearningProjection.function>` and parameter assignments.  Values specified
        for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default LearningProjection-<index>
        a string used for the name of the LearningProjection.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the LearningProjection.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
