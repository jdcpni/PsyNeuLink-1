.. _LearningProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A LearningProjection is a subclass of `ModulatoryProjection` that projects from a `LearningMechanism` to the
MATRIX `parameterState <ParameterState>` of a `MappingProjection` and modifies the value of the
`matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of that MappingProjection.  All of the LearningProjections in a System,
along with its other `learning components <LearningMechanism>`, can be displayed using the System's `show_graph` method
with its **show_learning** argument assigned as `True`.

.. _LearningProjection_Creation:

Creating a LearningProjection
------------------------------------

A LearningProjection can be created using any of the standard ways to `create a Projection <Projection_Creation>`,
or by including it in a tuple that specifies the `matrix <Mapping_Matrix_Specification>` parameter for a
`MappingProjection`.  LearningProjections are also created automatically, along with the other
`components required for learning <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>`, when learning is specified for a
`Process <Process_Learning>` or a `System <System_Execution_Learning>`.

If a LearningProjection is created using its constructor on its own, the `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>`
argument must be specified.  If it is included in the `matrix specification <Mapping_Matrix_Specification>` for a
`MappingProjection`, the *MATRIX* `ParameterState` for the MappingProjection will be assigned as the
LearningProjection's `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`.  If its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` is not
specified, its assignment depends on the `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`.  If the receiver belongs to a
MappingProjection that projects between two mechanisms that are both in the same `Process <Process_Learning>` or
`System <System_Execution_Learning>`, then the LearningProjection's `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` is assigned
to a `LearningSignal` of the `LearningMechanism` for the MappingProjection. If there is none, it is
`created <LearningMechanism_Creation>` along with any other components
needed to implement learning for the MappingProjection (see `LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations`).

.. _LearningProjection_Deferred_Initialization:

Deferred Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a LearningProjection is created, its full initialization is :ref:`deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its
`sender <LearningProjection.sender>` and `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This
allows a LearningProjection to be created before its `sender` and/or `receiver` have been created (e.g., before them
in a script), by calling its constructor without specifying its **sender** or **receiver** arguments.
However, for the LearningProjection to be operational, initialization must be completed by calling its `deferred_init`
method.  This is not necessary if learning has been specified for a `System <System_Execution_Learning>`,
`Process <Process_Learning>`, or as the `Projection <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>` in the `pathway` of a
Process -- in those cases, deferred initialization is completed automatically.

.. _LearningProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

The `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` of a LearningProjection is a `LearningSignal` of a `LearningMechanism`.  Its
`receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>` is the *MATRIX* `ParameterState` of a `MappingProjection`,  The
`function <LearningProjection.function>` of a LearningProjection is, by default, the identity function;  that is,
it conveys the `value <LearningSignal.value>` of its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` to
its `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`, for use in modifying the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter
of the `MappingProjection` being learned.

.. _LearningProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A LearningProjection cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the *MATRIX* ParameterState to which it
projects is updated.  This occurs when the `learned_projection <LearningProjection.learned_projection>` (i.e.,
`MappingProjection` to which the *MATRIX* ParameterState belongs) is updated. Note that these events occur only
when the ProcessingMechanism that receives the `learned_projection <LearningProjection.learned_projection>` is
executed (see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating). When the LearningProjection is
executed, it gets the `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>` from its
`sender <LearningProjection.sender>` (i.e., the `value <LearningSignal.value>` of the `LearningSignal` from which it
projects), and conveys that to its `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`, possibly modified by its `learning_rate
<LearningProjection.learning_rate>` parameter if that is specified (or it is specified for its
`sender <LearningProjection.sender>`).

.. note::
   The changes in the `matrix <MappingProjection.maitrix>` parameter of a `MappingProjection` in response to the
   execution of a LearningProjection are not applied until the `Mechanism` that receives MappingProjection are next
   executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

        Description:
            The LearningProjection class is a componentType in the Projection category of Function.
            It implements a Projection from the LEARNING_SIGNAL outputState of a LearningMechanism to the MATRIX
            parameterState of a MappingProjection that modifies its matrix parameter.
            It's function takes the output of a LearningMechanism (its learning_signal attribute), and provides this
            to the parameterState to which it projects, possibly scaled by the LearningProjection's learning_rate.

    COMMENT

    Arguments
    ---------
    sender : Optional[LearningMechanism or LearningSignal]
        the source of the `learning_signal` for the LearningProjection;  If it is not specified, one will be
        `automatically created <LearningProjection_Automatic_Creation>` that is appropriate for the
        LearningProjection's `errorSource <LearningProjection.errorSource>`.

    receiver : Optional[MappingProjection or ParameterState for ``matrix`` parameter of one]
        the `parameterState <ParameterState>` (or the `MappingProjection` that owns it) for the
        `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` to be modified by the LearningProjection.

    learning_function : Optional[LearningFunction or function] : default BackPropagation
        specifies a function to be used for learning by the `sender <LearningMechanism.sender>` (i.e., its
        `function <LearningMechanism.function>` attribute).

    learning_rate : Optional[float or int]
        if specified, it is applied multiplicatively to `learning_signal` received from the `LearningSignal`
        from which it projects (see `learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` for additional details).

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that specifies the parameters for the
        Projection, its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters. By default, it contains an entry for
        the Projection's default `function <LearningProjection.function>` and parameter assignments.  Values specified
        for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default LearningProjection-<index>
        a string used for the name of the LearningProjection.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the LearningProjection.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).


    Attributes
    ----------

    componentType : LEARNING_PROJECTION

    sender : LEARNING_SIGNAL OutputState of a LearningMechanism
        source of `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>`.

    receiver : MATRIX ParameterState of a MappingProjection
        parameterState for the `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of
        the `learned_projection` to be modified by the LearningProjection.

    learned_projection : MappingProjection
        the `MappingProjection` to which LearningProjection projects, and to which its
        `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>` and the `matrix <MappingProjection>` parameter to be modified belong.

    variable : 2d np.array
        same as `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>`.

    learning_signal : 2d np.array

        matrix of "weight" changes calculated by the LearningProjection's `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` and
        used to modify the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of its `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`
        (i.e., the `learned_projection <LearningProjection.learned_projection>`). Rows correspond to sender,
        columns to receiver (i.e., the input and output of the MappingProjection, respectively).

    function : Function : default Linear
        assigns the `learning_signal` received from `LearningMechanism` as the value of the Projection.

    weight_change_params : dict : default: see below
       specifies to the `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>` how the `weight_change_matrix` should be applied to the
       `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix> parameter of its `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`.  It assumes that the
       `function <MappingProjection.function>` of the receiver is `LinearCombination`.  By default it passes
       the following dictionary of specifications to the `receiver <LearningProjection.receiver>`::
           FUNCTION_PARAMS: {OPERATION: SUM,
                             PARAMETER_MODULATION_OPERATION: Modulation.ADD,
                             PROJECTION_TYPE: LEARNING_PROJECTION}

    learning_rate : Optional[float]
        determines the learning_rate for the LearningProjection.  If specified, it is applied multiplicatively to the
        `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>` and thus can be used to modulate the learning rate in
        addition to (and on top of) one specified for the `LearningMechanism` or its
        `function <LearningMechanism.function>`.  Specification of the
        `learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` for LearningProjection supercedes any specification(s) of
        the :keyword:`learning_rate` for any `Process <Process.Process_Base.learning_rate>` and/or
        `System <System.System_Base.learning_rate>` to which the LearningMechanism from which it projects belongs.
        See `learning_rate <LearningMechanism_Learning_Rate>` for additional details.

    weight_change_matrix : 2d np.array
        matrix of changes to be made to the `mappingWeightMatrix`, after learning_rate has been applied to the
        `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>`; same as `value <LearningProjection.value>`.

    value : 2d np.array
        same as `weight_change_matrix`.

    name : str : default LearningProjection-<index>
        the name of the LearningProjection.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the Projection;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for Projection.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the Projection;
        if it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in ``__init__.py``
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
