.. _ModulatoryProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A ModulatoryProjection is a subclass of `Projection <Projection>` that takes the value of a
`ModulatorySignal <ModulatorySignal>` belonging to an `AdaptiveMechanism <AdaptiveMechanism>`, and uses that to
modulate the function of the `state <State>` to which it projects.  There are three types of ModulatoryProjections,
that modulate different types of components and their states:

* `LearningProjection`
    takes the `value <LearningSignal.value>` of a `LearningSignal` belonging to a LearningMechanism,
    and conveys it to the *MATRIX* `ParameterState` of a `MappingProjection`, for use by its
    `function <ParameterState.function>` in modulating the value of the MappingProjection's
    `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter.
..
* `GatingProjection`
    takes the `value <GatingSignal.value>` of a `GatingSignal` belonging to a GatingMechanism,
    and conveys it to the `inputState <InputState>` or `outputState <OutputState>` of a `ProcessingMechanism`
    for use by the state's :keyword:`function` in modulating its :keyword:`value`.
..
* `ControlProjection`
    takes the `value of a <ControlSignal.value> of a `ControlSignal` belonging to a ControlMechanism,
    and conveys it to the `ParameterState` for the parameter of a `Mechanism` or its
    `function <Mechanism_Base.function>`, for use in modulating the value of the parameter.

.. _Projection_Creation:

Creating a ModulatoryProjection
-------------------------------

A ModulatoryProjection is a base class, and cannot be instantiated directly.  However, the three types of
ModulatoryProjections listed above can be created directly, by calling the constructor for the desired type.
More commonly, however, ModulatoryProjections are either specified `in context <Projection_In_Context_Specification>`,
or are `created automatically <Projection_Automatic_Creation>`, the details of which are described in the documentation
for each type of ModulatoryProjection.

.. _ModulatoryProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

A ModulatoryProjection has the same basic structure as a `Projection`, augmented by type-specific attributes
and methods described under each type of ModulatoryProjection.  The ModulatoryProjections received by a `State`
are listed in the State's `mod_afferents` attribute.

.. _ModulatoryProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A ModulatoryProjection, like any Projection, cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the `State` to
which it projects — its `receiver <Projection.receiver>` — is updated;  that occurs when the State's owner Mechanism
is executed.  When a ModulatoryProjection executes, it conveys both the value of the `ModulatorySignal` from which it
projects, and the ModulatorySignal's `modulation <ModulatorySignal.modulation>` attribute, to the State that receives
the Projection.  The State assigns the value to the parameter of the State's Function specified by the `modulation`
attribute, and then calls the function to determine the `value <State_Base.value>` of the state.

.. note::
   The change made to the parameter of the State's Function in response to the execution of a ModulatoryProjection
   are not applied until the state is updated which, in turn, does not occur until the Mechanism to which the State
   belongs is next executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

    Subclass of `Projection` that modulates the value of a `State`.

    .. note::
       ModulatoryProjection is an abstract class and should NEVER be instantiated by a call to its constructor.
       It should be instantiated using the constructor for a `subclass <ModulatoryProjection_Subtypes>`.

    Arguments
    ---------
    receiver : Optional[State or Mechanism]
        specifies the state to which the ModulatoryProjection projects.
    sender : Optional[OutputState or Mechanism] : default None
        specifies the component from which the ModulatoryProjection projects.
    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]] : default None
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that specifies the parameters for the
        projection, its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters. By default, it contains an entry for
        the projection's default `function <LearningProjection.function>` and parameter assignments.  Values specified
        for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.
    name : str : default LearningProjection-<index>
        a string used for the name of the LearningProjection.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).
    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences] : default : None
        the `PreferenceSet` for the LearningProjection.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
    context : str : default None
        optional reference to a subclass

    Attributes
    ----------
    receiver : MATRIX ParameterState of a MappingProjection
        the state to which the ModulatoryProjection projects, the `function <State_Base.function>` of which is
        modulated by it.
    sender : LEARNING_SIGNAL OutputState of a LearningMechanism
        the `ModulatorySignal` from which the ModulatoryProjection projects.
    variable : 2d np.array
        value received from the `ModulatorySignal` that is the projection's `sender <ModulatoryProjection.sender`.
    function : Function : default Linear
        assigns the value received from the ModulatoryProjection's `sender <ModualatoryProjection.sender>` to
        its `value <ModulatoryProjection.value>`.
    value : 2d np.array
        value used to modulate the function of the state that is its `receiver <ModulatoryProjection.receiver>`.
    name : str : default ModulatoryProjection-<index>
        the name of the ModulatoryProjection.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the projection;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by ProjectionRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).
    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Projection.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for projection.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the projection;
        if it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
