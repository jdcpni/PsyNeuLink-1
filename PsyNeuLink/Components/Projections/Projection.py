.. _Projection_Overview:

Overview
--------

Projections allow information to be passed between `Mechanisms <Mechanism>`.  A Projection takes its input from
its `sender <Projection.sender>` and transmits that information to its `receiver <Projection.receiver>`.  The
`sender <Projection.sender>` and `receiver <Projection.receiver>` of a Projection are always `States <State>`:
the`sender <Projection.sender>` is always the `OutputState` of a `Mechanism`; the `receiver <Projection.receiver>`
depends upon the type of Projection.  There are two broad categories of Projections, each of which has subtypes that
differ in the type of information they transmit, how they do this, and the type of `State` to which they project
(i.e., of their `receiver <Projection.receiver>`):

* `PathwayProjection`
    Used in conjunction with `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` to convey information along a processing
    `pathway <Process_Base.pathway`>.  There is currently one on type of PathwayProjection:

  * `MappingProjection`
      takes the `value <OutputState.value>` of an `OutputState` of a `ProcessingMechanism` converts it by convolving it
      with the MappingProjection's `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter, and transmits the
      result to the `InputState` of another ProcessingMechanism.  Typically, MappingProjections are used to connect
      Mechanisms in the `pathway` of a `Process`, though they can be use for other purposes as well (for example, to
      convey the output of an `ObjectiveMechanism` to an `AdaptiveMechanism`).

* `ModulatoryProjection`
    takes the `value <OutputState.value>` of a `ModulatorySignal` of an `AdaptiveMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>`,
    uses it to regulate modify the `value <State.value>` of an `InputState, `ParameterState` or `OutputState` of
    another Component.  ModulatorySignals are specialized types of `OutputState`, that are used to specify how to
    modify the `value <State.value>` of the `State` to which a ModulatoryProjection projects.  There are three types
    of ModulatoryProjections, corresponding to the three types of AdaptiveMechanisms (and corresponding
    ModulatorySignals; see `figure <ModulatorySignal_Anatomy_Figure>`), that project to different types of `States
    <State>`:

  * `LearningProjection`
      takes the `value <LearningSignal.value>` of a `LearningSignal` of a `LearningMechanism`, and transmits
      this to the `ParameterState` of a `MappingProjection` that uses this to modify its `matrix
      <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter. LearningProjections are used when learning has
      been specified for a `Process <Process_Learning>` or `System <System_Execution_Learning>`.
  ..
  * `ControlProjection`
      takes the `value <ControlSignal.value>` of a `ControlSignal` of a `ControlMechanism`, and transmit this
      to the `ParameterState of a `ProcessingMechanism` that uses this to modify the parameter of the (or its
      `function <Mechanism_Base.function>`) for which it is responsible.  ControlProjections are used when control
      has been used specified for a `System`.
  ..
  * `GatingProjection`
      takes the `value <GatingSignal.value>` of a `GatingSignal` of a `GatingMechanism`, and transmits this to
      the `InputState` or `OutputState` of a `ProcessingMechanism` that uses this to modify the State's `value
      <State.value>`

.. _Projection_Creation:

Creating a Projection
---------------------

A Projection can be created on its own, by calling the constructor for the desired type of Projection.  More
commonly, however, Projections are either specified `in context <Projection_In_Context_Specification>`, or
are `created automatically <Projection_Automatic_Creation>`, as described below.


.. _Projection_In_Context_Specification:

In Context Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projections can be specified in a number of places where they are required or permitted, for example in the
specification of a `pathway <Process_Base.pathway>` for a `Process`, where the value of a parameter is specified
(e.g., to assign a `ControlProjection`) or where a `MappingProjection` is specified  (to assign it a
`LearningProjection <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>`).  Any of the following can be used to specify a
Projection in context:

  * **Constructor**.  Used the same way in context as it is ordinarily.
  ..
  * **Projection reference**.  This must be a reference to a Projection that has already been created.
  ..
  * **Keyword**.  This creates a default instance of the specified type, and can be any of the following:

      * *MAPPING_PROJECTION* -- if the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and/or its `receiver
        <MappingProjection.receiver>` cannot be inferred from the context in which this specification occurs, then its
        `initialization is deferred <MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>` until both of those have been
        determined (e.g., it is used in the specification of a `pathway <Process_Base.pathway>` for a `Process`).
      |
      * *LEARNING_PROJECTION*  (or *LEARNING*) -- this can only be used in the specification of a `MappingProjection`
        (see `tuple <Mapping_Matrix_Specification>` format).  If the `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` of the
        MappingProjection projects to a `LearningMechanism` or a `ComparatorMechanism` that projects to one, then a
        `LearningSignal` is added to that LearningMechanism and assigned as the LearningProjection's `sender
        <LearningProjection.sender>`;  otherwise, a LearningMechanism is `automatically created
        <LearningMechanism_Creation>`, along with a LearningSignal that is assigned as the LearningProjection's `sender
        <LearningProjection.sender>`. See `LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations` for additional details.
      |
      * *CONTROL_PROJECTION* (or *CONTROL*)-- this can be used when specifying a parameter using the `tuple format
        <ParameterState_Tuple_Specification>`, to create a default `ControlProjection` to the `ParameterState` for that
        parameter.  If the `Component` to which the parameter belongs is part of a `System`, then a `ControlSignal` is
        added to the System's `controller <System_Base.controller>` and assigned as the ControlProjection's `sender
        <ControlProjection.sender>`;  otherwise, the ControlProjection's `initialization is deferred
        <ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>` until the Mechanism is assigned to a System, at which time the
        ControlSignal is added to the System's `controller <System_Base.controller>` and assigned as its the
        ControlProjection's `sender <ControlProjection.sender>`.  See `ControlMechanism_Control_Signals` for
        additional details.
      |
      * *GATING_PROJECTION* (or *GATING*)-- this can be used when specifying an `InputState <InputState_Projections>`
        or an `OutputState <OutputState_Projections>`, to create a default `GatingProjection` to the `State`.  If the
        GatingProjection's `sender <GatingProjection.sender>` cannot be inferred from the context in which this
        specification occurs, then its `initialization is deferred <GatingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>` until
        it can be determined (e.g., a `GatingMechanism` or `GatingSignal` is created to which it is assigned).
  ..
  * **Projection type**.  This creates a default instance of the specified Projection subclass.  The assignment or
    creation of the Projection's `sender <Projection.sender>` is handled in the same manner as described above for the
    keyword specifications.
  ..
  * **Specification dictionary**.  This can contain an entry specifying the type of Projection, and/or entries
    specifying the value of parameters used to instantiate it. These should take the following form:

      * *PROJECTION_TYPE*: *<name of a Projection type>* --
        if this entry is absent, a default Projection will be created that is appropriate for the context
        (for example, a `MappingProjection` for an `InputState`, a `LearningProjection` for the `matrix
        <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of a `MappingProjection`, and a `ControlProjection` for any other
        type of parameter.
      |
      * *PROJECTION_PARAMS*: *Dict[Projection argument, argument value]* --
        the key for each entry of the dictionary must be the name of a Projection parameter, and its value the value
        of the parameter.  It can contain any of the standard parameters for instantiating a Projection (in particular
        its `sender <Projection_Sender>` and `receiver <Projection_Receiver>`, or ones specific to a particular type
        of Projection (see documentation for subclass).  If the `sender <Projection_Sender>` and/or
        `receiver <Projection_Receiver>` are not specified, their assignment and/or creation are handled in the same
        manner as described above for keyword specifications.

      COMMENT:
          WHAT ABOUT SPECIFICATION USING OutputState/ModulatorySignal OR Mechanism?
      COMMENT

      COMMENT:  ??IMPLEMENTED FOR PROJECTION PARAMS??
        Note that parameter
        values in the specification dictionary will be used to instantiate the Projection.  These can be overridden
        during execution by specifying `runtime parameters <Mechanism_Runtime_parameters>` for the Projection,
        either when calling the `execute <Mechanism_Base.execute>` or `run <Mechanism_Base.run>`
        method for a Mechanism directly, or where it is specified in the `pathway` of a Process.
      COMMENT

.. _Projection_Automatic_Creation:

Automatic creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under some circumstances Projections are created automatically. For example, a `Process` automatically creates a
`MappingProjection` between adjacent `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` in its `pathway
<Process_Base.pathway>` if none is specified; and `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` are automatically created
when :keyword:`learning` is specified for a `Process <Process_Learning>` or `System <System_Execution_Learning>`).

.. _MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization:

Deferred Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a Projection is created, its full initialization is `deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its `sender
<ControlProjection.sender>` and `receiver <ControlProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This allows
a Projection to be created before its `sender` and/or `receiver` have been created (e.g., before them in a script),
by calling its constructor without specifying its **sender** or **receiver** arguments. However, for the Projection
to be operational, initialization must be completed by calling its `_deferred_init` method.  Under most conditions
this occurs automatically (e.g., when the projection is assigned to a type of Component that expects to be the
`sender <Projection.sender>` or `receiver <Projection.receiver>` for that type of Projection); these conditions are
described in the section on *Deferred Initialization* for each type of Projection.  Otherwise, the Projection's
`_deferred_init` method must be called explicitly, once the missing attribute assignments have been made.


.. _Projection_Structure:

Structure
---------

In addition to its `function <Projection.function>`, a Projection has two primary attributes: a `sender
<Projection.sender>` and `receiver <Projection.receiver>`.  The types of `State(s) <State>` that can be
assigned to these, and the attributes of those States to which Projections of each type are assigned, are
summarized in the following table, and described in greater detail in the subsections below.

|                      | (`efferents <OutputState.efferents>`) | (`mod_afferents <State_Base.mod_afferents>`)     |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

.. _Projection_Sender:

Sender
~~~~~~

This must be an `OutputState` or a `ModulatorySignal` (a subclass of OutputState specialized for `ModulatoryProjections
<ModulatoryProjection>`).  The Projection is assigned to the OutputState or ModulatorySignal's `efferents
<State_Base.efferents>` list and, for ModulatoryProjections, to the list of ModulatorySignals specific to the
`AdaptiveMechanism` from which it projects.  The OutputState or ModulatorySignal's `value <OutputState.value>` is
used as the `variable <Function.variable>` for Projection's `function <Projection.function>`.

A sender can be specified as:

  * an **OutputState** or **ModulatorySignal**, as appropriate for the Projection's type, using any of the ways for
    `specifying an OutputState <OutputState_Specification>`.
  ..
  * a **Mechanism**;  for a `MappingProjection`, the Mechanism's `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` is
    assigned as the `sender <Projection.sender>`; for a `ModulatoryProjection`, a `ModulatorySignal` of the appropriate
    type is created and assigned to the Mechanism.

If the `sender <Projection.sender>` is not specified and it can't be determined from the context, or an OutputState
specification is not associated with a Mechanism that can be determined from context, then the initialization of the
Projection is `deferred <Projection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

.. _Projection_Receiver:

Receiver
~~~~~~~~

The `receiver <Projection.receiver>` required by a Projection depends on its type, as listed below:

    * MappingProjection: `InputState`
    * LearningProjection: `ParameterState` (for the `matrix <MappingProjection>` of a `MappingProjection`)
    * ControlProjection: `ParameterState`
    * GatingProjection: `InputState` or OutputState`

A `MappingProjection` (as a `PathwayProjection`) is assigned to the `path_afferents <State.path_afferents>` attribute
of its `receiver <Projection.receiver>`.  The ModulatoryProjections are assigned to the `mod_afferents
<State.mod_afferents>` attribute of their `receiver <Projection.receiver>`.

A `receiver <Projection.receiver>` can be specified as:

  * an existing **State**;
  ..
  * an existing **Mechanism** or **Projection**; which of these is permissible, and how a state is assigned to it, is
    determined by the type of Projection — see subclasses for details).
  ..
  * a **specification dictionary** (see subclasses for details).


.. _Projection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A Projection cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the `State` to which it projects (i.e., its `receiver
<Projection.receiver>`) is updated;  that occurs when the State's owner `Mechanism` is executed.  When a
Projection executes, it gets the value of its `sender <Projection.sender>`, assigns this as the `variable
<Projection.variable>` of its `function <Projection.function>`, calls the `function <Projection.function>`, and
provides the result as to its `receiver <Projection.receiver>`.  The `function <Projection.function>` of a Projection
converts the value received from its `sender <Projection.sender>` to a form suitable as input for its `receiver
<Projection.receiver>`.
