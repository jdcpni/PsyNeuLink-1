Overview
--------

A State provides an interface to one or more `Projections <Projection>`, and receives the `value(s) <Projection>`
provide by them.  The value of a State can be modulated by a `ModulatoryProjection`. There are three primary types of
States, all of which are used by `Mechanisms <Mechanism>`, one of which is used by
`MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`, and that are subject to modulation by `ModulatorySignals <ModulatorySignal>`,
as summarized in the table below:

COMMENT:

* `InputState`:
    used by a Mechanism to receive input from `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`;
    its value can be modulated by a `GatingSignal`.

* `ParameterState`:
    * used by a Mechanism to represent the value of one of its parameters, or a parameter of its
      `function <Mechanism.function>`, that can be modulated by a `ControlSignal`;
    * used by a `MappingProjection` to represent the value of its `matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>`
      parameter, that can be modulated by a `LearningSignal`.

* `OutputState`:
    used by a Mechanism to send its value to any efferent projections.  For
    `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` these are `PathwayProjections <PathwayProjection>`, most commonly
    `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`.  For `ModulatoryMechanisms <ModulatoryMechanism>`, these are
    `ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>` as described below. The `value <OutputState.value>` of an
    OutputState can be modulated by a `GatingSignal`.

* `ModulatorySignal`:
    a subclass of `OutputState` used by `AdaptiveMechanisms <AdaptiveMechanism>` to modulate the value of the primary
    types of States listed above.  There are three types of ModulatorySignals:

    * `LearningSignal`, used by a `LearningMechanism` to modulate the *MATRIX* ParameterState of a `MappingProjection`;
    * `ControlSignal`, used by a `ControlMechanism` to modulate the `ParameterState` of a `Mechanism`;
    * `GatingSignal`, used by a `GatingMechanism` to modulate the `InputState` or `OutputState` of a `Mechanism`.
    Modulation is discussed further `below <State_Modulation>`, and described in detail under
    `ModulatorySignals <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>`.

.. _State_Creation:

Creating a State
----------------

In general, States are created automatically by the objects to which they belong (their `owner <State_Owner>`),
or by specifying the State in the constructor for its owner.  For example, unless otherwise specified,
when a `Mechanism` is created it creates a default `InputState` and `OutputState` for itself, and whenever any
Component is created, it automatically creates a `ParameterState` for each of its
`configurable parameters <Component_Configurable_Attributes>` and those of its `function <Component_Function>`.
States are also created in response to explicit specifications.  For example, InputStates and OutputStates can be
specified in the constructor for a Mechanism (see `Mechanism_State_Specification`) or in its `add_states` method;
and a ParameterState is specified in effect when the value of a parameter for any Component or its
`function <Component.function>` is specified in its constructor.  InputStates and OutputStates (but not
ParameterStates) can also be created directly using their constructors;  however, Parameter States cannot be created
in this way; they are always and only created when the Component to which a parameter belongs is created.

.. _State_Specification:

Specifying a State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wherever a State is specified, it can be done using any of the following:

    * an existing **State** object;
    ..
    * the name of a **State subclass** (`InputState`, `ParameterState`, or `OutputState`) - a default State of the
      corresponding type will be created, using a default value for the State that is determined by the context
      in which it is specified.
    ..
    * a **value**.  This creates a default State using the specified value as its default `value <State_Base.value>`.
    ..
    * a **State specification dictionary**; every State specification can contain the following: *KEY*:<value>
      entries, in addition to those specific to a particular State subtype (see subtype documentation):

      ..
      * *NAME*:<str>
          the string is used as the name of the State;

      ..
      * *STATE_TYPE*:<State type>
          specifies type of State to create (necessary if it cannot be determined from the
          the context of the other entries or in which it is being created)
      ..
      * *VALUE*:<value>
          the value is used as the default value of the State;
      ..
      * *PROJECTIONS*:<List>
          the list must contain specifications for one or more
          `projections <Projection_In_Context_Specification> to or from the State, and/or
          `ModulatorySignals <ModulatorySignal>` from which it should receive projections;
          the type of Projections it can send and/or receive depends the type of State and
          the context in which it is specified;
          COMMENT:
              REFER TO TABLE OF STATES AND TYPES OF PREOJCTIONS THEY CAN RECEIVE
          COMMENT
      ..
      * *str*:<List>
          the key is used as the name of the State, and the list must contain specifications for
          one or more `Projections <Projection_In_Context_Specification>` to or from the State
          depending on the type of State and the context in which it is specified;
        ..

    * a **2-item tuple** - the first item must be a value, used as the default value for the State,
      and the second item must be a specification for a `Projection <Projection_In_Context_Specification>`
      to or from the State, depending on the type of State and the context in which it is specified;

.. _State_Deferred_Initialization:

`InputStates <InputState>`, `OutputStates <OutputState>` and `ModulatorySignals <ModulatorySignal>` can also be
created on their own, by using the relevant constructors;  however, `ParameterStates <ParameterState>` cannot be
created on their own. If a State is created on its own, and its `owner <State_Owner>` is not specified, then its
initialization will be `deferred <Component_Deferred_Initialization>`.  Its initialization is completed automatically
when it is assigned to an owner `Mechanism <Mechanism_Base>` using the owner's `add_states` method.  If the State is
not assigned to an owner, it will not be functional (i.e., used during the execution of `Mechanisms
<Mechanism_Base_Execution>` and/or `Compositions <Composition_Execution>`, irrespective of whether it has any
`Projections <Projection>` assigned to it.

.. _State_Projections:

Projections
~~~~~~~~~~~

When a State is created, it can be assigned one or more `Projections <Projection>`, using either the **projections**
argument of its constructor, or in an entry of a dictionary assigned to the **params** argument with the key
*PROJECTIONS*. The following of types of Projections can be specified for each type of State:

    * `InputState`
        • `PathwayProjection(s) <PathwayProjection>`
          - assigned to its `pathway_afferents <Input.pathway_afferents>` attribute.
        • `GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>`
          - assigned to its `mod_afferents <InputState.mod_afferents>` attribute.

    * `ParameterState`
        • `ControlProjection(s) <ControlProjection>` - assigned to its `mod_afferents <ParameterState.mod_afferents>`
          attribute.

    * `OutputState`
        • `PathwayProjection(s) <PathwayProjection>`
          - assigned to its `efferents <Output.efferents>` attribute.
        • `GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>`
          - assigned to its `mod_afferents <OutputState.mod_afferents>` attribute.

    * `ModulatorySignal`
        • `ModulatoryProjection(s) <ModulatoryProjection>`
          - assigned to its `efferents <ModulatorySignal.efferents>` attribute.

Projections must be specified in a list.  Each entry must be either a specification for a `projection
<Projection_In_Context_Specification>`, or for a `sender <Projection.sender>` or `receiver <Projection.receiver>`,
in which case the appropriate type of Projection is created.  A sender or receiver can be specified as a `State` or a
`Mechanism`. If a Mechanism is specified, its primary `InputState <InputState_Primary>` or `OutputState
<OutputState_Primary>`  is used, as appropriate.  When a sender or receiver is used to specify the Projection, the type
of Projection created is inferred from the State and the type of sender or receiver specified, as illustrated in the
examples below.  Note that the State must be `assigned to an owner <State_Creation>` in order to be functional,
irrespective of whether any `Projections <Projection>` have been assigned to it.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The following creates an InputState ``my_input_state`` with a `MappingProjection` to it from the
`primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` of ``mech_A``::

    my_input_state = InputState(projections=[mech_A])

The following creates a `GatingSignal` with `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` to ``mech_B`` and ``mech_C``,
and assigns it to a ``my_gating_mech``::

    my_gating_signal = GatingSignal(projections=[mech_B, mech_C])
    my_gating_mech = GatingMechanism(gating_signals=[my_gating_signal]

The GatingMechanism created will now gate the `primaryInputStates <Mechanism_InputStates>` of ``mech_B`` and ``mech_C``.

.. _State_Structure:

Structure
---------

.. _State_Owner:

Owner
~~~~~

Every State has an `owner <State_Base.owner>`.  For `InputStates <InputState>` and `OutputStates <OutputState>`, the
owner must be a `Mechanism`.  For `ParameterStates <ParameterState>` it can be a `Mechanism` or a `PathwayProjection`.
For `ModulatorySignals <ModulatorySignal>`, it must be an `AdaptiveMechanism`.  When a State is created as part of
another Component, its `owner <State_Base.owner>` is assigned automatically to that Component.  It is also assigned
automatically when the State is assigned to a `Mechanism` using that Mechanism's `add_states` method.  Otherwise, it
must be specified explicitly in the **owner** argument of the constructor for the State.  If it is not, the State's
initialization will be `deferred <State_Deferred_Initialization>` until it has been assigned to an owner.

Variable, Function and Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition, like all PsyNeuLink Components, it also has the three following core attributes:

    * `variable <State_Base.variable>`:  for an `InputState` and `ParameterState`,
      the value of this is determined by the value(s) of the Projection(s) that it receives (and that are listed in
      its `path_afferents <State_Base.path_afferents>` attribute).  For an `OutputState`, it is the item of the owner
      Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.value>` to which the OutputState is assigned (specified by the OutputState's
      `index <OutputState_Index>` attribute.
    ..
    * `function <State_Base.function>`:  for an `InputState` this aggregates the values of the Projections that the
      State receives (the default is `LinearCombination` that sums the values), under the potential influence of a
      `GatingSignal`;  for a `ParameterState`, it determines the value of the associated parameter, under the
      potential influence of a `ControlSignal` (for a `Mechanism`) or a `LearningSignal` (for a `MappingProjection`);
      for an OutputState, it conveys the result  of the Mechanism's function to its
      `output_values <Mechanism.output_values>` attribute, under the potential influence of a `GatingSignal`.  See
      `ModulatorySignals <ModulatorySignal_Structure>` and the `AdaptiveMechanism <AdaptiveMechanism>` associated with
      each type for a description of how they can be used to modulate the `function <State_Base.function>` of a State.
    ..
    * `value <State_Base.value>`:  for an `InputState` this is the aggregated value of the `PathwayProjections` it
      receives;  for a `ParameterState`, this represents the value of the parameter that will be used by the
      State's owner or its `function <Component.function>`; for an `OutputState`, it is the item of the  owner
      Mechanism's `value <Mechanisms.value>` to which the OutputState is assigned, possibly modified by its
      `calculate <OutputState_Calculate>` attribute and/or a `GatingSignal`, and used as the
      `value <Projection.value>` of the projections listed in its `efferents <OutputState.path_efferents>` attribute.

.. _State_Modulation:

Modulation
~~~~~~~~~~

Every type of State has a `mod_afferents <State_Base.mod_afferents>` attribute, that lists the
`ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>` it receives.  Each ModulatoryProjection comes from a `ModulatorySignal`
that specifies how it should modulate the State's `value <State_Base.value>` when the State is updated (see
`ModulatorySignal_Modulation` and `ModulatorySignal_Anatomy_Figure`).  In most cases, a ModulatorySignal uses the
State's `function <State_Base.function>` to modulate its `value <State_Base.value>`.  The function of every State
assigns one of its parameters as its *MULTIPLICATIVE_PARAM* and another as its *MULTIPLICATIVE_PARAM*. The
`modulation <ModulatorySignal.modulation>` attribute of a ModulatorySignal determines which of these to modify when the
State uses it `function <State_Base.function>` to calculate its `value  <State_Base.value>`.  However, the
ModulatorySignal can also be configured to override the State's `value <State_Base.value>` (i.e., assign it directly),
or to disable modulation, using one of the values of `ModulationParam` for its
`modulation <ModulatorySignal.modulation>` attribute (see `ModulatorySignal_Modulation` for a more detailed discussion).

.. _State_Execution:

Execution
---------

States cannot be executed.  They are updated when the Component to which they belong is executed.  InputStates and
ParameterStates belonging to a Mechanism are updated before the Mechanism's function is called.  OutputStates are
updated after the Mechanism's function is called.  When a State is updated, it executes any Projections that project
to it (listed in its `all_afferents <State_Base.all_afferents>` attribute.  It uses the values it receives from any
`PathWayProjections` (listed in its `path_afferents` attribute) as the variable for its
`function <State_Base.function>`. It then executes all of the ModulatoryProjections it receives.  Different
ModulatorySignals may call for different forms of modulation (see `ModulatorySignal_Modulation`).  Accordingly,
it separately sums the values specified by any ModulatorySignals for the *MULTIPLICATIVE_PARAM* of its
`function <State_Base.function>`, and similarly for the *ADDITIVE_PARAM*.  It then applies the summed value for each
to the corresponding parameter of its `function <State_Base.function>`.  If any of the ModulatorySignals specifies
*OVERRIDE*, then the value of that ModulatorySignal is used as the State's `value <State_Base.value>`. Finally,
the State calls its `function <State_Base.function>` to determine its `value <State_Base.value>`.

.. note::
   The change in the value of a `State` does not occur until the Mechanism to which the State belongs is next
   executed; This conforms to a "lazy evaluation" protocol (see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation
   of "lazy" updating).

                validates and assigns value, and updates observers
                returns None
            - update_state(context) -
                updates self.value by combining all projections and using them to compute new value
                return None

        StateRegistry
        -------------
            Used by .__init__.py to assign default projection types to each State subclass
            Note:
            * All States that belong to a given owner are registered in the owner's _stateRegistry,
                which maintains a dict for each State type that it uses, a count for all instances of that type,
                and a dictionary of those instances;  NONE of these are registered in the StateRegistry
                This is so that the same name can be used for instances of a State type by different owners
                    without adding index suffixes for that name across owners,
                    while still indexing multiple uses of the same base name within an owner

        Arguments
        ---------
        - value (value) - establishes type of value attribute and initializes it (default: [0])
        - owner(Mechanism) - assigns State to Mechanism (default: NotImplemented)
        - params (dict):  (if absent, default State is implemented)
            + FUNCTION (method)         |  Implemented in subclasses; used in update()
            + FUNCTION_PARAMS (dict) |
            + PROJECTIONS:<projection specification or list of ones>
                if absent, no projections will be created
                projection specification can be: (see Projection for details)
                    + Projection object
                    + Projection class
                    + specification dict
                    + a list containing any or all of the above
                    if dict, must contain entries specifying a projection:
                        + PROJECTION_TYPE:<Projection class>: must be a subclass of Projection
                        + PROJECTION_PARAMS:<dict>? - must be dict of params for PROJECTION_TYPE
        - name (str): if it is not specified, a default based on the class is assigned in register_category,
                            of the form: className+n where n is the n'th instantiation of the class
        - prefs (PreferenceSet or specification dict):
             if it is omitted, a PreferenceSet will be constructed using the classPreferences for the subclass
             dict entries must have a preference keyPath as their key, and a PreferenceEntry or setting as their value
             (see Description under PreferenceSet for details)
        - context (str): must be a reference to a subclass, or an exception will be raised
    COMMENT

    Attributes
    ----------

    owner : Mechanism or Projection
        object to which the State belongs (see `State_Owner` for additional details).

    base_value : number, list or np.ndarray
        value with which the State was initialized.

    all_afferents : Optional[List[Projection]]
        list of all Projections received by the State (i.e., for which it is a `receiver <Projection.receiver>`.

    path_afferents : Optional[List[Projection]]
        list all `PathwayProjections <PathwayProjection>` received by the State.
        (note:  only `InputStates <InputState>` have path_afferents;  the list is empty for other types of States).

    mod_afferents : Optional[List[GatingProjection]]
        list of all `ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>` received by the State.

    efferents : Optional[List[Projection]]
        list of outgoing Projections from the State (i.e., for which is a `sender <Projection.sender>`
        (note:  only `OutputStates <OutputState>` have efferents;  the list is empty for other types of States).

    function : TransferFunction : default determined by type
        used to determine the State's own value from the value of the Projection(s) it receives;  the parameters that
        the TransferFunction identifies as ADDITIVE and MULTIPLICATIVE are subject to modulation by a
        `ModulatoryProjection <ModulatoryProjection_Structure>`.

    value : number, list or np.ndarray
        current value of the State (updated by `update <State_Base.update>` method).

    name : str : default <State subclass>-<index>
        the name of the State.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the State;
        if not specified, a default is assigned by StateRegistry based on the
        States's subclass (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming,
        including for default and duplicate names).

        .. note::
            Unlike other PsyNeuLink Components, States names are "scoped" within a Mechanism, meaning that States with
            the same name are permitted in different Mechanisms.  However, they are *not* permitted in the same
            Mechanism: States within a Mechanism with the same base name are appended an index in the order of their
            creation).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : State.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for the State.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the projection;  if it is not specified, a default is
        assigned using `classPreferences` defined in ``__init__.py``
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).
