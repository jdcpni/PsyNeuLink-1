"""
Overview
--------

A GatingSignal is a type of `ModulatorySignal` that is specialized for use with a `GatingMechanism` and one or more
`GatingProjections <GatingProjection>`, to modify the `value <State_Base.value>` \(s) of the InputState(s) and/or
OutputState(s) to which they project. A GatingSignal receives the value from the
`gating_policy <GatingMechanism.gating_policy>` of the GatingMechanism to which it belongs, and assigns that as
the value of its `gating_signal <GatingSignal.gating_signal>` to its `GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>`, each
of which projects to an InputState or OutputState and is used to modulate the `value <State_Base.value>` of that State.


.. _GatingSignal_Creation:

Creating a GatingSignal
-----------------------

A GatingSignal is created automatically whenever an `InputState` or `OutputState` of a `Mechanism` is specified for
gating.  This can be done either in the **gating_signals** argument of the constructor for a
`GatingMechanism <GatingMechanism_GatingSignals>`, or in the `specification of projections <State_Projections>` to
the InputState or OutputState.  Although a GatingSignal can be created directly using its constructor (or any of the
other ways for `creating an OutputState <OutputStates_Creation>`), this is usually not necessary nor is it advisable,
as a GatingSignal has dedicated components and requirements for configuration that must be met for it to function
properly.

.. _GatingSignal_Specification:

Specifying GatingSignals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a GatingSignal is specified in the **gating_signals** argument of the constructor for a `GatingMechanism`, the
InputState(s) and/or OutputState(s) it gates must be specified. This can take any of the following forms:

  * an **InputState** or **OutputState** of a Mechanism;
  ..
  * a **Mechanism**, in which case its `primary `InputState <InputState_Primary>` or `OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`
    is used;
  ..
  * a **tuple**, with the name of the state as the 1st item, and the Mechanism to which it belongs as the 2nd;
    note that this is a convenience format, which is simpler to use than a specification dictionary (see below),
    but precludes specification of any `parameters <GatingSignal_Structure>` for the GatingSignal.
  ..
  * a **specification dictionary**, that can take either of the following two forms:

    * for a single state, the dictionary must have the following two entries:

        * *NAME*: str
            the string must be the name of the State to be gated; the GatingSignal will named by appending
            "_GatingSignal" to the name of the State.

        * *MECHANISM*: Mechanism
            the Mechanism must be the one to the which the State to be gated belongs.

    * for multiple states, the dictionary must have the following entry:

        * <str>:list
            the string used as the key specifies the name to be used for the GatingSignal,
            and each item of the list must be a `specification of a State <State_Creation>` to be
            gated by the GatingSignal (and that will receive a `GatingProjection` from it).

    The dictionary can also contain entries for any other GatingSignal attributes to be specified
    (e.g., a *MODULATION* entry, the value of which determines how the GatingSignal modulates the
    `value <State_Base.value>` of the State(s) that it gates); see `below <GatingSignal_Structure>`
    for a description of GatingSignal attributes.

.. _GatingSignal_Structure:

Structure
---------

A GatingSignal is owned by a `GatingMechanism`, and associated with one or more `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>`,
each of which projects to the InputState or OutputState that it gates.

.. _GatingSignal_Projections:

Projections
~~~~~~~~~~~

When a GatingSignal is created, it can be assigned one or more `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>`, using either
the **projections** argument of its constructor, or in an entry of a dictionary assigned to the **params** argument
with the key *PROJECTIONS*.  These will be assigned to its `efferents  <GatingSignal.efferents>` attribute.  See
`State Projections <State_Projections>` for additional details concerning the specification of Projections when
creating a State.

.. note::
   Although a GatingSignal can be assigned more than one `GatingProjection`, all of those Projections will convey
   the same `gating_signal <LearningMechanism>` (received from the GatingMechanism to which the GatingSignal
   belongs), and use the same form of `modulation <GatingSignal_Modulation>`.  This can be useful for implementing
   broadly projecting modulatory effects.

.. _GatingSignal_Modulation:

Modulation
~~~~~~~~~~

Each GatingSignal has a `modulation <GatingSignal.modulation>` attribute that determines how the GatingSignal's
`value <GatingSignal.value>` (i.e., its `gating_signal <GatingSignal.gating_signal>`) is used by the States to which it
projects to modify their `value <State_Base.value>` \s (see `ModulatorySignal_Modulation` for an explanation of how the
`modulation <GatingSignal.modulation>` attribute is specified and used to modulate the `value <State_Base.value>` of a
State). The `modulation <GatingSignal.modulation>` attribute can be specified in the **modulation** argument of the
constructor for a GatingSignal, or in a specification dictionary as described `above <GatingSignal_Specification>`.
The value must be a value of `ModulationParam`;  if it is not specified, its default is the value of the `modulation
<GatingMechanism.modulation>` attribute of the GatingMechanism to which the GatingSignal belongs (which is the same
for all of the GatingSignals belonging to that GatingMechanism).  The value of the
`modulation <GatingSignal.modulation>` attribute of a GatingSignal is used by all of the
`GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` that project from that GatingSignal.


.. _GatingSignal_Execution:

Execution
---------

A GatingSignal cannot be executed directly.  It is executed whenever the `GatingMechanism` to which it belongs is
executed.  When this occurs, the GatingMechanism provides the GatingSignal with one of the values from its
`gating_policy <GatingMechanism.gating_signal>`, that is used by its `function <GatingSignal.function>` to generate its
the value of its `gating_signal <GatingSignal.gating_signal>`.  That, in turn, is used by its `GatingProjection(s)
<GatingProjection>` to modulate the `value <State_Base.value>` of the States to which they project. How the modulation
is executed is determined by the GatingSignal's `modulation <GatingSignal.modulation>` attribute
(see `above <GatingSigna_Modulation>`, and `ModulatorySignal_Modulation` for a more detailed explanation of how
modulation operates).

.. note::
   The change in the `value <State_Base.value>` of InputStates and OutputStates in response to the execution of a
   GatingSignal are not applied until the Mechanism(s) to which those states belong are next executed;
   see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

.. _GatingSignal_Examples:

Examples
~~~~~~~~

**Gate an InputState and OutputState**.  In the following example, `GatingMechanism` is configured to gate the
`primary InputState <InputState_Primary>` of one Mechanism, and the `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>`
of another::

    my_mechanism_A = TransferMechanism()
    my_mechanism_B = TransferMechanism()
    my_gating_mechanism = GatingMechanism(gating_signals=[my_mechanism_A, my_mechanism_B.output_state)

Note that, in the **gating_signals** argument, the first item references a Mechanism (``my_mechanism_A``) rather than
one of its states -- this is all that is necessary, since the default for a `GatingSignal` is to modulate the
`primary InputState <InputState_Primary>` of a Mechanism.  The second item explicitly specifies the State to be gated,
since it is an OutputState.  This will generate two GatingSignals, each of which will multiplicatively modulate the
value of the State to which it projects.  This is because, by default, the `modulation <GatingSignal.modulation>`
attribute of a GatingSignal is the *MULTIPLICATIVE_PARAM* for the `function <State_Base.function>` of the State to which
it projects.  For an InputState, the default `function <InputState.function>` is `Linear` and its *MULTIPLICATIVE_PARAM*
is its `slope <Linear.slope>` parameter.  Thus, the value of the GatingSignal is assigned to the slope, which multiplies
the State`s `variable <State_Base.variable>` (i.e., its input(s)) to determine its `value <State_Base.value>`.

**Modulate the InputStates of several Mechanisms**.  In next example, a `GatingMechanism` is created that modulates
the `InputState` of all the layers in a 3-layered feedforward neural network.  Ordinarily, gating modulates the
*MULTIPLICATIVE_PARAM* of an InputState's `function <InputState.function>`.  In the example, this is changed so that
it adds the `value <GatingSignal.value>` of the `GatingSignal` to the `value <InputState.value>` of each InputState::

    my_input_layer = TransferMechanism(size=3)
    my_hidden_layer = TransferMechanism(size=5)
    my_output_layer = TransferMechanism(size=2)
    my_gating_mechanism = GatingMechanism(gating_signals=[
                                            {'GATE_ALL': [my_input_layer,
                                                          my_hidden_layer,
                                                          my_output_layer]},
                                             modulation=ModulationParam.ADDITIVE)

Note that, again, the **gating_signals** are listed as Mechanisms, since in this case it is their primary InputStates
that are to be gated. Since they are all listed in a single entry of a
`specification dictionary <_GatingSignal_Specification>`, they will all be gated by a single GatingSignal named
``GATE_ALL``, that will send a `GatingProjection` to the InputState of each of the Mechanisms listed (the next example
shows how different InputStates can be differentially gated by a `GatingMechanism`). Finally, note that the
`ModulationParam` specified for the `GatingMechanism` (and therefore the default for its GatingSignals, pertains to
the `function <InputState.function>` of each `InputState`. By default that is a `Linear` function, the *ADDITIVE_PARAM*
of which is its `intercept <Linear.intercept>` parameter. Therefore, in the example above, each time the InputStates
are updated, the value of the GatingSignal will be assigned as the `intercept` of each InputState's
`function <InputState.function>`, thus adding that amount to the input to the State before determining its
`value <InputStat.value>`.

**Gate InputStates differentially**.  In the example above, the InputStates for all of the Mechanisms were gated
using a single GatingSignal.  In the example below, a different GatingSignal is assigned to the InputState of each
Mechanism::

    my_gating_mechanism = GatingMechanism(gating_signals=[{NAME: 'GATING_SIGNAL_A',
                                                           MODULATION: ModulationParam.ADDITIVE,
                                                           PROJECTIONS: my_input_layer},
                                                          {NAME: 'GATING_SIGNAL_B',
                                                           PROJECTIONS: [my_hidden_layer,
                                                                         my_output_layer]}])

Here, two GatingSignals are specified as `specification dictionaries <GatingSignal_Specification>`, each of which
contains an entry for the name of the GatingSignal, and a *PROJECTIONS* entry that specifies the States to which the
GatingSignal should project (i.e., the ones to be gated).  Once again, the specifications exploit the fact that the
default is to gate the `primary InputState <InputState_Primary>` of a Mechanism, so those are what are referenced. The
first dict also contains a  *MODULATION* entry that specifies the value of the `modulation <GatingSignal.modulation>`
attribute for the GatingSignal.  The second one does not, so the default will be used (which, for a GatingSignal, is
`ModulationParam.MULTIPLICATIVE`).  Thus, the InputState of ``my_input_layer`` will be additively modulated by
``GATING_SIGNAL_A``, while the InputStates of ``my_hidden_layer`` and ``my_output_layer`` will be multiplicatively
modulated by ``GATING_SIGNAL_B``.

**Creating and assigning stand-alone GatingSignals**.  GatingSignals can also be created on their own, and then later
assigned to a GatingMechanism.  In the example below, the same GatingSignals specified in the previous example are
created directly and then assigned to ``my_gating_mechanism``::

    my_gating_signal_A = GatingSignal(name='GATING_SIGNAL_A',
                                      modulation=ModulationParams.ADDITIVE,
                                      projections=my_input_layer)
    my_gating_signal_B = GatingSignal(name='GATING_SIGNAL_B',
                                      projections=my_hidden_layer,
                                                  my_output_layer)
    my_gating_mechanism = GatingMechanism(gating_signals=[my_gating_signal_A,
                                                          my_gating_signal_B])

    COMMENT


    Arguments
    ---------

    owner : GatingMechanism
        specifies the `GatingMechanism` to which to assign the GatingSignal.

    function : Function or method : default Linear
        specifies the function used to determine the value of the GatingSignal from the value of its
        `owner <GatingMechanism.owner>`.

    modulation : ModulationParam : default ModulationParam.MULTIPLICATIVE
        specifies the way in which the `value <GatingSignal.value>` the GatingSignal is used to modify the
        `value <State_Base.value>` of the State(s) to which the GatingSignal's
        `GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>` project.

    projections : list of Projection specifications
        specifies the `GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>` to be assigned to the GatingSignal, and that will be
        listed in its `efferents <GatingSignal.efferents>` attribute (see `GatingSignal_Projections` for additional
        details).

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the ControlSignal and/or a custom function and its parameters. Values specified for parameters in the dictionary
        override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default OutputState-<index>
        a string used for the name of the OutputState.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by the StateRegistry of the Mechanism to which the OutputState
        belongs (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : State.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the OutputState.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).


    Attributes
    ----------

    owner : GatingMechanism
        the `GatingMechanism` to which the GatingSignal belongs.

    variable : number, list or np.ndarray
        used by `function <GatingSignal.function>` to compute the GatingSignal's `value <GatingSignal.value>`.

    function : TransferFunction :  default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0)
        provides the GatingSignal's `value <GatingMechanism.value>`; the default is an identity function that
        passes the input to the GatingMechanism as value for the GatingSignal.

    value : number, list or np.ndarray
        result of the GatingSignal's `function <GatingSignal.function>`
        (same as its `gating_signal <GatingSignal.gating_signal>`).

    gating_signal : number, list or np.ndarray
        result of the GatingSignal's `function <GatingSignal.function>` (same as its `value <GatingSignal.value>`).


    modulation : ModulationParam
        determines the way in the which `value <GatingSignal.value>` of the GatingSignal is used to modify the
        `value <State_Base.value>` of the State(s) to which the GatingSignal's
        `GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>` project.

    efferents : [List[GatingProjection]]
        a list of the `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` assigned to (i.e., that project from) the GatingSignal.

    name : str : default <State subclass>-<index>
        name of the OutputState.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the OutputState.  If not is specified, a default is
        assigned by the StateRegistry of the Mechanism to which the OutputState belongs
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

        .. note::
            Unlike other PsyNeuLink components, State names are "scoped" within a Mechanism, meaning that States with
            the same name are permitted in different Mechanisms.  However, they are *not* permitted in the same
            Mechanism: States within a Mechanism with the same base name are appended an index in the order of their
            creation.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : State.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for the OutputState.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the projection;  if it is not specified, a default is
        assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).

        - an existing InputState or OutputState for a Mechanisms in self.system
        - a list of state specifications (see below)
        - a dictionary that contains either a:
            - single state specification:
                NAME:str - contains the name of an InputState or OutputState belonging to MECHANISM
                MECHANISM:Mechanism - contains a reference to a Mechanism in self.system that owns NAME'd state
                <PARAM_KEYWORD>:<GatingSignal param value>
            - multiple state specification:
                NAME:str - used as name of GatingSignal
                STATES:List[tuple, dict] - each item must be state specification tuple or dict
                <PARAM_KEYWORD>:<GatingSignal param value>

    Each state specification must be a:
        - (str, Mechanism) tuple
        - {NAME:str, MECHANISM:Mechanism} dict
        where:
            str is the name of an InputState or OutputState of the Mechanism,
            Mechanism is a reference to an existing that belongs to self.system

    Checks for duplicate state specifications within state_spec or with any existing GatingSignal of the owner
        (i.e., states that will receive more than one GatingProjection from the owner)

    If state_spec is already a GatingSignal, it is returned (in the GATING_SIGNAL entry) along with its parsed elements

    Returns dictionary with the following entries:
        NAME:str - name of either the gated state (if there is only one) or the GatingSignal
        STATES:list - list of states to be gated
        GATING_SIGNAL:GatingSignal or None
        PARAMS:dict - params dict if any were included in the state_spec
