"""

Overview
--------

OutputState(s) represent the result(s) of executing a Mechanism.  This may be the result(s) of its
`function <OutputState.function>` and/or values derived from that result.  The full set of results are stored in the
Mechanism's `output_value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.output_value>` attribute.  OutputStates are used to represent
individual items of the Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>`, and/or useful quantities derived from
them.  For example, the `function <TransferMechanism.TransferMechanism.function>` of a `TransferMechanism` generates
a single result (the transformed value of its input);  however, a TransferMechanism can also be assigned OutputStates
that represent its mean, variance or other derived values.  In contrast, the `function <DDM.DDM.function>`
of a `DDM` Mechanism generates several results (such as decision accuracy and response time), each of which can be
assigned as the `value <OutputState.value>` of a different OutputState.  The OutputState(s) of a Mechanism can serve
as the input to other  Mechanisms (by way of `projections <Projections>`), or as the output of a Process and/or
System.  The OutputState's `efferents <OutputState.efferents>` attribute lists all of its outgoing
projections.

.. _OutputStates_Creation:

Creating an OutputState
-----------------------

An OutputState can be created by calling its constructor. However, in general this is not necessary, as a Mechanism
automatically creates a default OutputState if none is explicitly specified, that contains the primary result of its
`function <Mechanism_Base.function>`.  For example, if the Mechanism is created within the `pathway` of a
`Process <Process>`, an OutputState will be created and assigned as the
`sender <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.sender>` of a `MappingProjection` to the next Mechanism in the pathway,
or to the Process' `output <Process_Input_And_Output>` if the Mechanism is a `TERMINAL` Mechanism for that Process.
Other configurations can also easily be specified using a Mechanism's **output_states** argument (see
`OutputState_Specification` below).

An OutputState must be owned by a `Mechanism`.  When OutputState is specified in the constructor for a `Mechanism`
(see `below <InputState_Specification>`), it is automatically assigned to that Mechanism as its owner. If the
OutputState is created directly, its `owner <OutputState.owner>` can specified in the **owner** argument of its
constructor; otherwise, its initialization will be `deferred <State_Deferred_Initialization>` until it is assigned to
an owner using the owner's `add_states` method.

.. _OutputState_Primary:

Primary OutputState
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every Mechanism has at least one OutputState, referred to as its *primary OutputState*.  If OutputStates are not
`explicitly specified <OutputState_Specification>` for a Mechanism, a primary OutputState is automatically created
and assigned to its `output_state <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.output_state>` attribute (note the singular),
and also to the first entry of the Mechanism's `output_states <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.output_states>` attribute
(note the plural).  The `value <OutputState.value>` of the primary OutputState is assigned as the first (and often
only) item of the Mechanism's `output_value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.output_value>` attribute, which is the result
of the Mechanism's `function <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.function>`.

.. _OutputState_Specification:

OutputState Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OutputState(s) for a Mechanism can be specified explicitly using the **output_states** argument of the
`Mechanism's constructor <Mechanism_OutputStates>`, or in an *OUTPUT_STATES* entry of a parameter dictionary
assigned to the constructor's **params** argument.  The latter takes precedence over the former (that is, if
OutputStates are specified in the parameter dictionary, any specified in the **output_states** argument are ignored).

.. note::
    Assigning OutputStates to a Mechanism in its constructor **replaces** any that are automatically generated for that
    Mechanism (i.e., those that it creates for itself by default).  If any of those need to be retained, they must be
    explicitly specified in the list assigned to the **output_states** argument or the *OUTPUT_STATES* entry of
    the parameter dictionary in the **params** argument).  In particular, if the default OutputState -- that usually
    contains the result of the Mechanism's `function <Mechanism_Base.function>` -- is to be retained, it too must be
    specified along with any additional OutputStates desired.

OutputStates can also be added* to a Mechanism, using the Mechanism's `add_states` method.  Unlike specification
in the constructor, this **does not** replace any OutpuStates already assigned to the Mechanism. Doing so appends
them to the list of OutputStates in the Mechanism's `output_states <Mechanism_Base.output_states>` attribute,
and their values are appended to its `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute.  If the name of an
OutputState added to a Mechanism is the same as one that already exists, its name will be suffixed with a numerical
index (incremented for each OutputState with that name), and the OutputState will be added to the list (that is,
it will *not* replace ones that were already created).

Specifying an OutputState can be done in any of the ways listed below.  To create multiple OutputStates, their
specifications can be included in a list, or in a dictionary in which the key for each entry is a string specifying
the name for the OutputState to be created, and the value its specification.  Any of the following can be used to
specify an OutputState:

    * An **existing OutputState object** or the name of one.  Its `variable <OutputState.variable>` must match (in the
      number and type of its elements) the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` to
      which the OutputState is assigned (designated by its `index <OutputState_Index>` attribute).
    ..
    * The **OutputState class**, keyword *OUTPUT_STATE*, or a string.  This creates a default OutputState using the
      first item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` as the OutputState's
      `variable <InputState.variable>`, and is assigned as the `primary OutputState <OutputState_Primary>` for the
      Mechanism. If the class name or *INPUT_STATE* keyword is used, a default name is assigned to the State;  if a
      string is used, it is assigned as the name of the InputState (see :ref:`naming conventions <LINK>`).
    ..
    * A **value**.  This creates a default OutputState using the specified value as the OutputState's
      `variable <OutputState.variable>`.  This must be compatible with (have the same number and type of elements as)
      the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` to which the OutputState is assigned
      (the first item by default, or the one designated by its `index <OutputState.index>` attribute).  A default
      name is assigned based on the name of the Mechanism (see :ref:`naming conventions <LINK>`).
    ..
    * A **State specification dictionary**.  This creates the specified OutputState using the item of the owner
      `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` specified by the *INDEX* entry  as OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`.
      In addition to the standard entries of a `State specification dictionary <State_Specification>`, the dictionary
      can have a *PROJECTIONS* entry, the value of which can be a `Projection`, a
      `Projection specification dictionary <Projection_In_Context_Specification>`, or a list containing items that
      are either of those.  This can be used to specify one or more efferent `PathwayProjections <PathwayProjection>`
      from the OutpuState, and/or `ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>` for it to receive.
    ..
    * A **2-item tuple**.  The first item must be a value, and the second a `ModulatoryProjection` specification.
      This creates a default OutputState using the first item as the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`,
      and assigns the OutputState as the `receiver `ModualtoryProjection.receiver` of the type of ModulatoryProjection
      specified in the second item.

    .. note::
       In all cases, the `variable <OutputState.variable>` of the OutputState must match (have the same number and
       type of elements) as the item of its owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` to which it is
       assigned (i.e., specified by its `index <OutputState.index>` attribute).

The values of a Mechanism's OutputStates are assigned as items in its `output_values <Mechanism.output_values>`
attribute, in the order in which they are assigned in the **output_states** argument of its constructor, and listed
in its `output_states <Mechanism.output_states>` attribute.  Note that the `output_values <Mechanism.output_values>`
attribute of a Mechanism is distinct from its `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` attribute, which contains the full and
unmodified results of its `function <Mechanism_Base.function>` (this is because OutputStates may modify the item
of the Mechanism`s `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` to which they refer -- see `below <OutputState_Customization>`).


.. _OutputState_Standard:

Standard OutputStates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most types of Mechanisms have a `standard_output_states` class attribute, that contains a list of predefined
OutputStates relevant to that type of Mechanism (for example, the `TransferMechanism` class has OutputStates for
calculating the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of its result).  The names of these are listed as
attributes of a class with the name *<ABBREVIATED_CLASS_NAME>_OUTPUT*.  For example, the TransferMechanism class
defines `TRANSFER_OUTPUT`, with attributes *MEAN*, *MEDIAN*, *VARIANCE* and *STANDARD_DEVIATION* that are the names of
predefined OutputStates in its `standard_output_states <TransferMechanism.standard_output_states>` attribute.
These can be used in the list of OutputStates specified for a TransferMechanism object, as in the following example::

    my_mech = TransferMechanism(default_variable=[0,0],
                                function=Logistic(),
                                output_states=[TRANSFER_OUTPUT.RESULT,
                                               TRANSFER_OUTPUT.MEAN,
                                               TRANSFER_OUTPUT.VARIANCE)

In this example, ``my_mech`` is configured with three OutputStates;  the first will be named *RESULT* and will
represent logistic transform of the 2-element input vector;  the second will be named  *MEAN* and will represent mean
of the result (i.e., of its two elements); and the third will be named *VARIANCE* and contain the variance of the
result.

.. _OutputState_Customization:

OutputState Customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default OutputState uses the first (and usually only) item of the owner Mechanism's
`value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` as its value.  However, this can be modified in two ways, using the
OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>` and `calculate <OutputState.calculate>` attributes (see
`OutputState_Attributes` below). If the Mechanism's `function <Mechanism_Base.function>` returns a value with more
than one item (i.e., a list of lists, or a 2d np.array), then an OutputState can be assigned to any of those items by
specifying its `index <OutputState.index>` attribute. An OutputState can also be configured to transform
the value of the item, by specifying a function for its `calculate <OutputState.calculate>` attribute; the result
will then be assigned as the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`.  An OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>`
and `calculate <OutputState.calculate>` attributes can be assigned when the OutputState is assigned to a Mechanism,
by including *INDEX* and *CALCULATE* entries in a  `specification dictionary <OutputState_Specification>` for the
OutputState, as in the following example::

    my_mech = DDM(function=BogaczEtAl(),
                  output_states=[ DDM.DECISION_VARIABLE,
                                  DDM.PROB_UPPER_THRESHOLD,
                                  {NAME: 'DECISION ENTROPY',
                                   INDEX: 2},
                                   CALCULATE: Entropy().function }])

COMMENT:
   ADD VERSION IN WHICH INDEX IS SPECIFICED USING DDM_standard_output_states
COMMENT

In this example, ``my_mech`` is configured with three OutputStates.  The first two are standard OutputStates that
represent the decision variable of the DDM and the probability of it crossing of the upper (vs. lower) threshold.  the
third is a custom OutputState, that computes the entropy of the probability of crossing the upper threshold.  It uses
the `Entropy` Function for its `calculate <OutputState.calculate>` attribute, and *INDEX* is assigned ``2`` to
reference the third item of the DDM's `value <DDM.value>` attribute (items are indexed starting with 0), which contains
the probability of crossing the upper threshold.  The three OutputStates will be assigned to the
`output_states <Mechanism.output_states>` attribute of ``my_mech``, and their values will be assigned as items in its
`output_value <Mechanism.output_value>` attribute, in the order in which they are listed in the **output_states**
argument of the constructor for ``my_mech``.

Custom OutputStates can also be created on their own, and separately assigned or added to a Mechanism.  For example,
the ``DECISION ENTROPY`` OutputState could be created as follows::

    decision_entropy_output_state = OutputState(name='DECISION ENTROPY',
                                                index=2,
                                                calculate=Entropy().function)

and then assigned either as::

    my_mech = DDM(function=BogaczEtAl(),
                  output_states=[ DDM.DECISION_VARIABLE,
                                  DDM.PROB_UPPER_THRESHOLD,
                                  decision_entropy_output_state])

or::

    my_mech = DDM(function=BogaczEtAl(),
                  output_states=[ DDM.DECISION_VARIABLE,
                                  DDM.PROB_UPPER_THRESHOLD)

    my_mech.add_state(decsion_entropy_output_state)


.. _OutputState_Projections:

Projections
~~~~~~~~~~~

When an OutputState is created, it can be assigned one or more `Projections <Projection>`, using either the
**projections** argument of its constructor, or in an entry of a dictionary assigned to the **params** argument with
the key *PROJECTIONS*.  An OutputState can be assigned either `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` or
`GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>`.  MappingProjections are assigned to its `efferents <OutputState.efferents>`
attribute and GatingProjections to its `mod_afferents <OutputState.mod_afferents>` attribute.  See
`State Projections <State_Projections>` for additional details concerning the specification of Projections when
creating a State.


.. _OutputState_Structure:

Structure
---------

Every OutputState is owned by a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`. It can send one or more
`MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` to other Mechanisms.  If its owner is a `TERMINAL` Mechanism of a Process
and/or System, then the OutputState will also be treated as the output of that `Process <Process_Input_And_Output>`
and/or of a System.  The `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` sent by an OutputState are listed in its
`efferents <OutputState.efferents>` attribute.  An OutputState can also receive one or more `GatingProjections
<GatingProjection>` and that regulate its value (see the descriptions of Modulation under
`ModulatorySignals <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` and `GatingSignals <GatingSignal_Modulation>` for additional details).
The GatingProjections received by an OutputState are listed in its `mod_afferents <OutputState.mod_afferents>`
attribute.

Like all PsyNeuLink components, an OutputState has the three following core attributes:

* `variable <OutputState.variable>`:  the item of its owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>`
  to which it is assigned (designated by its `index <OutputState.index>` attribute);  it must match the value of that
  item (both in the number and types of its elements).
..
* `function <OutputState.function>`: takes the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` as its input, and
  generates the OutpuState's `value <OutputState.value>` as its result.  The default function is `Linear` that simply
  assigns the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` as its `value <OutputState.value>`.  However, the
  parameters of the `function <OutputState.function>` -- and thus the `value <OutputState.value>` of the OutputState --
  can be modified by any `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the OutputState (listed in its
  `mod_afferents <OutputState.mod_afferents>` attribute.  A custom function can also be specified, so long as it can
  take as its input a value that is compatiable with the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`.
..
* `value <OutputState.value>`:  assigned the result of the function specified by the
  `calculate <OutputState.calculate>` attribute, possibly modified by the result of the OutputState`s
  `function <OutputState.function>` and any `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the OutputState.
  It is used as the input to any projections that the OutputStatue sends.

.. _OutputState_Attributes:

Additional Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An OutputState also has two additional attributes that determine its operation, and can be used to further
`customize the OutputState <OutputState_Customization>`:

.. _OutputState_Index:

* `index <OutputState.index>`: this determines the item of its owner Mechanism's
  `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` to which it is assigned.  By default, this is set to 0, which assigns it to
  the first item of the Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>`.  The `index <Mechanism.index>` must be
  equal to or less than one minus the number of OutputStates listed in the Mechanism's
  `output_states <Mechanism.output_states>` attribute.  The `variable <OutputState.variable>` of the
  OutputState must also match (in the number and type of its elements) the item of the Mechanism's
  `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` designated by the `index <OutputState.index>`.

.. _OutputState_Calculate:

* `calculate <OutputState.calculate>`:  this specifies a function used to convert the item of the owner Mechanism's
  `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` (designated by the OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>` attribute),
  before providing it to the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`.  The `calculate <OutputState.calculate>`
  attribute can be assigned any function that accept the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>` as its input,
  and that generates a result that can be used the input for the OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>`.
  The default is an identity function (`Linear` with **slope**\\ =1 and **intercept**\\ =0), that simply assigns the
  specified item of the Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` unmodified as the input for OutputState's
  `function <OutputState.function>`.


.. _OutputState_Execution:

Execution
---------

An OutputState cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the Mechanism to which it belongs is executed.
When the Mechanism is executed, it places the results of its execution in its `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>`
attribute. The OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>` attribute designates the item of the Mechanism's
`value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` for use by the OutputState.  The OutputState is updated by calling the function
specified by its `calculate <OutputState_Calculate>` attribute with the designated item of the Mechanism's
`value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` as its input.  This is used by the Mechanism's
`function <Mechanism_Base.function>`, possibly under the influence of any `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` it
receives, to generate the `value <OutputState.value>` of the OutputState.  This is assigned to a corresponding item
of the Mechanism's `output_values  <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute, and is used as the
input to any projections for which the OutputState is the `sender <Projection.Projection.sender>`.

            It is used primarily as the sender for MappingProjections
            Its FUNCTION updates its value:
                note:  currently, this is the identity function, that simply maps variable to self.value

        StateRegistry
        -------------
            All OutputStates are registered in StateRegistry, which maintains an entry for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances

    COMMENT


    Arguments
    ---------

    owner : Mechanism
        the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` to which the OutputState belongs; it must be specified or determinable from the
        context in which the OutputState is created.

    reference_value : number, list or np.ndarray
        a template that specifies the format of the item of the owner Mechanism's
        `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` attribute to which the OutputState will be assigned (specified by
        the **index** argument).  This must match (in number and type of elements) the OutputState's
        **variable** argument.  It is used to insure the compatibility of the source of the
        input for the OutputState with its `variable <OutputState.variable>`.

    variable : number, list or np.ndarray
        specifies the template for the OutputState's `variable <OutputState.variable>`.

    size : int, list or np.ndarray of ints
        specifies variable as array(s) of zeros if **variable** is not passed as an argument;
        if **variable** is specified, it takes precedence over the specification of **size**.

    function : Function, function, or method : default LinearCombination(operation=SUM)
        specifies the function used to transform the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>`
        designated by the OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>` attribute, under the possible influence of
        `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the OutputState.

    index : int : default PRIMARY_OUTPUT_STATE
        specifies the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` used as input for the
        function specified by the OutputState's `calculate <OutputState.calculate>` attribute, to determine the
        OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`.

    calculate : Function, function, or method : default Linear
        specifies the function used to convert the designated item of the owner Mechanism's
        `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` (specified by the OutputState's :keyword:`index` attribute),
        before it is assigned as the OutputState's `value <OutputState.value>`.  The function must accept a value that
        has the same format (number and type of elements) as the item of the Mechanism's
        `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>`.

    projections : list of Projection specifications
        species the `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` to be sent by the OutputState, and/or
        `GatingProjections(s) <GatingProjection>` to be received (see `OutputState_Projections` for additional details);
        these will be listed in its `efferents <OutputState.efferents>` and `mod_afferents <InputState.mod_afferents>`
        attributes, respectively (see `OutputState_Projections` for additional details).

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterState_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters for
        the OutputState, its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters. Values specified for parameters
        in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the constructor.

    name : str : default OutputState-<index>
        a string used for the name of the OutputState.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by the StateRegistry of the Mechanism to which the OutputState
        belongs (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : State.classPreferences]
        the `PreferenceSet` for the OutputState.
        If it is not specified, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).


    Attributes
    ----------

    owner : Mechanism
        the Mechanism to which the OutputState belongs.

    mod_afferents : List[GatingProjection]
        a list of the `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the InputState.

    variable : value, list or np.ndarray
        assigned the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` specified by the
        OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>` attribute.

    index : int
        the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` used as input for the function
        specified by its `calculate <OutputState.calculate>` attribute.

    calculate : function or method : default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0))
        function used to convert the item of the owner Mechanism's `value <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.value>` specified by
        the OutputState's `index <OutputState.index>` attribute.  The result is combined with the result of the
        OutputState's `function <OutputState.function>` to determine both the `value <OutputState.value>` of the
        OutputState, as well as the value of the corresponding item of the owner Mechanism's `output_values
        <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.output_values>`. The default (`Linear`) transfers the value unmodified.

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0))
        function used to assign the result of the OutputState's `calculate <OutputState.calculate>` function,
        under the possible influence of `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` received by the OutputState,
        to its `value <OutputState.value>`, as well as to the corresponding item of the owner's `output_values
        <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute.

    value : number, list or np.ndarray
        assigned the result of `function <OutputState.function>`;  the same value is assigned to the corresponding item
        of the owner Mechanism's `output_values <Mechanism.Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute.

    efferents : List[MappingProjection]
        a list of the `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` sent by the OutputState (i.e., for which the OutputState
        is a `sender <Projection.Projection.sender>`).

    name : str : default <State subclass>-<index>
        name of the OutputState.
        Specified in the **name** argument of the constructor for the OutputState.  If not is specified, a default is
        assigned by the StateRegistry of the Mechanism to which the OutputState belongs
        (see :doc:`Registry <LINK>` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).

        .. note::
            Unlike other PsyNeuLink components, State names are "scoped" within a Mechanism, meaning that States with
            the same name are permitted in different Mechanisms.  However, they are *not* permitted in the same
            Mechanism: States within a Mechanism with the same base name are appended an index in the order of their
            creation.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : State.classPreferences
        the `PreferenceSet` for the OutputState.
        Specified in the **prefs** argument of the constructor for the projection;  if it is not specified, a default is
        assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py
        (see :doc:`PreferenceSet <LINK>` for details).

    Arguments
    ---------
    owner : Component
        the Component to which this OutputState belongs

    output_state_dicts : list of dicts
        list of dictionaries specifying OutputStates for the Component specified

        The effects of each value of indices are as follows:

            * PRIMARY_OUTPUT_STATES -- assigns the INDEX for the owner's primary OutputState to all indices

            * SEQUENTIAL -- assigns sequentially incremented int to each INDEX entry

            * list of ints -- assigns each int to the corresponding entry in `output_state_dicts`

            * None -- assigns `None` to each INDEX entry

    Attributes
    ----------
    data : dict
        dictionary of OutputState specification dictionaries

    indices : list
        list of default indices for each OutputState specified

    names : list
        list of the default names for each OutputState

    Methods
    -------
    get_state_dict(name)
