Overview
--------

.. _Run_Overview:

The :keyword:`run` function is used for executing a Mechanism, Process or System.  It can be called directly, however
it is typically invoked by calling the :keyword:`run` method of the Component to be run.  It  executes a Component by
calling the Component's :keyword:`execute` method.  While a Component's :keyword:`execute` method can be called
directly, using its :keyword:`run` method is easier because it:

    * allows multiple rounds of execution to be run in sequence, whereas the :keyword:`execute` method of a Component
      runs only a single execution of the object;
    ..
    * uses simpler formats for specifying `inputs <Run_Inputs>` and `targets <Run_Targets>`;
    ..
    * automatically aggregates results across executions and stores them in the results attribute of the object.

Understanding a few basic concepts about how the :keyword:`run` function operates will make it easier to use the
:keyword:`execute` and :keyword:`run` methods of PsyNeuLink Components.  These are discussed below.


.. _Run_Scope_of_Execution:

Scope of Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the :keyword:`run` method of a Component is called, it executes that Component and all others within its scope of
execution.  For a `Mechanism`, the scope of execution is simply the Mechanism itself.  For a `Process`, the scope of
execution is all of the Mechanisms specified in its `pathway` attribute.  For a `System`, the scope of execution is
all of the Mechanisms in the Processes specified in the System's `Processes <System.System_Base.processes>` attribute.

.. _Run_Timing:

Timing
~~~~~~

When :keyword:`run` is called by a Component, it calls that Component's :keyword:`execute` method once for each
`input <Run_Inputs>`  (or set of inputs) specified in the call to :keyword:`run`, which constitutes a `TRIAL` of
execution.  For each `TRIAL`, the Component makes repeated `calls to its Scheduler <Scheduler_Execution>`,
executing the Components it specifies in each `TIME_STEP`, until every Component has been executed at least once or
another `termination condition <Scheduler_Termination_Conditions>` is met.  The `Scheduler` can be used in combination
with `Condition` specifications for individual Components to execute different Components at different time scales.

.. note::
   The **time_scale** argument of :keyword:`run`, described below, is currently not fully implemented,
   but will be in a subsequent version.

.. _Run_Time_Scale::

The :keyword:`run` function also has a **time_scale** argument, that can be used to globally specify the time_scale
parameter for those Components that make use of it.  Any value of `TimeScale` can be specified; how it is interpreted
is determined by the Component. For example, some Mechanisms that perform integration (such as the `DDM`) offer the
option of using an analytic solution (that computes the integral in a single `TIME_STEP`), or a numerical method
(that carries out one step of integration per `TIME_STEP`).  If `TimeScale.TIME_STEP` is assigned as the value of the
**time_scale** argument in a call to :keyword:`run`, those Mechanisms will use their numerical integration method,
whereas if `TimeScale.TRIAL` is assigned they will use their analytic solution.  Similarly, for `TimeScale.TIME_STEP`,
`TransferMechanisms <TransferMechanism>` integrate their input prior to applying the transfer function (sometimes
referred to as "time averaging" or "cascade mode"), whereas for `TimeScale.TRIAL` they apply it to their current input
(i.e., execute their transfer an "instantaneously").

.. _Run_Inputs:

Inputs
~~~~~~

The :keyword:`run` function presents the inputs for each `TRIAL` to the input_states of the relevant Mechanisms in
the `scope of execution <Run_Scope_of_Execution>`. These are specified in the **inputs** argument of a Component's
:keyword:`execute` or :keyword:`run` method. For a Mechanism, they comprise the `variable <InputState.variable>` for
each of the Mechanism's `InputStates <InputState>`.  For a Process or System, they comprise the
`variable <InputState.variable>` for the InputState(s) of the `ORIGIN` Mechanism(s).  Inputs can be specified in one
of two ways: `Sequence format <Run_Inputs_Sequence_Format>` and `Mechanism format <Run_Dict_format>`.
Sequence format is more complex, but does not require the specification of Mechanisms by name, and thus may better
suited for automated means of generating inputs.  Mechanism format requires that inputs be assigned to Mechanisms by
name, but is easier to use (as the order in which the inputs are specified does not matter, so long as they are paired
with their Mechanisms).  Both formats require that inputs be specified as nested lists or ndarrays, that define the
number of trials, mechanisms, InputStates and elements for each input.  These factors determine the levels of nesting
required for a list, or the dimensionality (number of axes) for an ndarray.  They are described below, followed by a
description of the two formats.

.. note::
   The descriptions below are for completeness, and are intended as a technical reference;  or most uses of
   of :keyword:`run` methods, it is only necessary to understand the relatively simple Mechanism formate
   described `below <Run_Inputs_Mechanism_Format>`.

.. _Run_Nesting_Factors:

* **Number of TRIALS**.  If the **inputs** argument contains the input for more than one `TRIAL`, then the outermost
  level of the list, or axis 0 of the ndarray, is used for the `TRIAL` \s, each item of which contains the
  set inputs for a given `TRIAL`.  Otherwise, it is used for the next relevant factor in the list below.  If the
  number of inputs specified is less than the number of `TRIAL` \s, then the input list is cycled until the full
  number of `TRIAL` \s is completed.
..
* **Number of Mechanisms.** If :keyword:`run` is used for a System, and it has more than one `ORIGIN` Mechanism, then
  the next level of nesting of a list, or next higher axis of an ndarray, is used for the `ORIGIN` Mechanisms, with
  each item containing the inputs for a given `ORIGIN` Mechanism within a `TRIAL`.  This factor is not relevant
  when :keyword:`run` is used for a single Mechanism, a Process (which only ever has one `ORIGIN` Mechanism),
  or a System that has only one `ORIGIN` Mechanism.  It is also not relevant for the
  `Mechanism format <Run_Inputs_Mechanism_Format>`, since that separates the inputs for each Mechanism into individual
  entries of a dictionary.
..
* **Number of InputStates.** In general, Mechanisms have only a single (`primary <Mechanism_InputStates>`) InputState;
  however, some types of Mechanisms can have more than one.  If any `ORIGIN` Mechanism in a Pocess or System has more
  than one InputState, then the next level of nesting of a list, or next higher axis of an ndarray, is used for the
  set of InputStates for each Mechanism.
..
* **Number of elements for the value of an InputState.** The input for an InputState can be a single element (e.g.,
  a scalar) or have multiple elements (e.g., a vector).  By convention, even if the input to an InputState is a single
  element, it should nevertheless always be specified as a list or a 1d np.array (it is internally converted to the
  latter).  PsyNeuLink can usually parse single-element inputs specified as a stand-alone value (e.g., as a number
  not in a list or ndarray).  Nevertheless, it is best to embed such inputs in a single-element list or a 1d array,
  both for clarity and to insure consistent treatment of nested lists and ndarrays.  If this convention is followed,
  then the number of elements for a given input should not affect nesting of lists or dimensionality (number of axes)
  of ndarrays of an **inputs** argument.

With these factors in mind, the **inputs** argument can be specified in the simplest form possible (least
number of nestings for a list, or lowest dimension of an ndarray).  It can be specified using one of two formats:

.. _Run_Inputs_Sequence_Format:

Sequence Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
   This format is included for backward compatability, but may not be supported in the future.  It is **strongly**
   recommended that the `Mechanism format <Run_Inputs_Mechanism_Format>` be used instead.  That said, please feel
   free to convey any strong preference for this format to the development team, so that an informed decision can
   be made about future inclusion of this format.

*(List[values] or ndarray)* -- this uses a nested list or ndarray to fully specify the input for
each `TRIAL` in a sequence.  It is more complex than the `Mechanism format <Run_Inputs_Mechanism_Format>`,
and for Systems requires that the inputs for each Mechanism be specified in the same order in which those Mechanisms
appear in the System's `origin_Mechanisms <System.System_Base.origin_mechanisms>` attribute.  This is generally the
same order in which they are declared, and can be displayed using the System's `show <System.System_Base.show>`
method). Although this format is more complex, it may be better suited to automated input generation, since it does
not require that Mechanisms be referenced explicitly (though it is allowed). The following provides a description of
the Sequence format for all of the combinations of factors describe `above <Run_Inputs_Mechanism_Format>`.
The `figure <Run_Sequence_Format_Fig>` below shows examples.

    *Lists:* if there is more than one `TRIAL`, then the outermost level of the list is used for the sequence of
    `TRIALS`.  If there is only one `ORIGIN` Mechanism and it has only one InputState (the most common
    case), then a single sublist is used for the input of each `TRIAL`.  If the `ORIGIN` Mechanism has more
    than one InputState, then the entry for each `TRIAL` is a sublist of the InputStates, each entry of which is a
    sublist containing the input for that InputState.  If there is more than one Mechanism, but none have more than
    one InputState, then a sublist is used for each Mechanism in each `TRIAL`, within which a sublist is used for the
    input for that Mechanism.  If there is more than one Mechanism, and any have more than one InputState,
    then a sublist is used for each Mechanism for each `TRIAL`, within which a sublist is used for each
    InputState of the corresponding Mechanism, and inside that a sublist is used for the input for each InputState.

    *ndarray:*  axis 0 is used for the first factor (`TRIAL`, Mechanism, InputState or input) for which there is only
    one item, axis 1 is used for the next factor for which there is only one item, and so forth.  For example, if there
    is more than one `TRIAL`, only one `ORIGIN` Mechanism, and that has only one InputState (the most common case),
    then axis 0 is used for `TRIAL`, and axis 1 for inputs per `TRIAL`.  At the other extreme, if there are multiple
    `TRIALS`, more than one `ORIGIN` Mechanism, and more than one InputState for one or more of the `ORIGIN` Mechanisms,
    then axis 0 is used for `TRIAL` `s, axis 1 for Mechanisms within `TRIAL`, axis 2 for InputStates of each Mechanism,
    and axis 3 for the input to each InputState of a Mechanism.  Note that if *any* Mechanism being run (directly, or as
    one of the `ORIGIN` Mechanisms of a Process or System) has more than one InputState, then an axis must be
    committed to InputStates, and the input to every InputState of every Mechanism must be specified in that axis
    (i.e., even for those Mechanisms that have a single InputState).

       Example input specifications in Sequence format

.. _Run_Inputs_Mechanism_Format:

Mechanism Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*(Dict[Mechanism, List[values] or ndarray])* -- this provides a simpler format for specifying :keyword:`inputs` than
the Sequence format, and does not require that the inputs for each Mechanism be specified in a particular order.
However, it requires that each Mechanism that receives inputs be referenced explicitly (instead of by order),
which may be less suitable for automated forms of input generation.  It uses a dictionary, each entry of which is the
sequence of inputs for an `ORIGIN` Mechanism;  there must be one such entry for each of the `ORIGIN` Mechanisms of the
Process or System being run.  The key for each entry is the `ORIGIN` Mechanism, and the value contains either a list
or ndarray specifying the sequence of inputs for that Mechanism, one for each `TRIAL` to be run.  If a list is used,
and the Mechanism has more than one InputState, then a sublist is used in each item of the list to specify the inputs
for each of the Mechanism's InputStates for that `TRIAL`.  If an ndarray is used, axis 0 is used for the sequence of
`TRIAL` \s. If the Mechanism has a single InputState, then axis 1 is used for the input for each `TRIAL.  If the
Mechanism has multiple InputStates, then axis 1 is used for the InputStates, and axis 2 is used for the input to each
InputState for each `TRIAL`.

       :alt: Mechanism format input specification
       :align: center

       Mechanism format input specification

.. _Run_Initial_Values:

Initial Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any Mechanism that is the `sender <Projection.Projection.sender>` of a Projection that closes a loop in a Process or
System, and that is not an `ORIGIN` Mechanism, is designated as `INITIALIZE_CYCLE`. An initial value can be assigned
to such Mechanisms, that will be used to initialize them when the Process or System is first run.  These values are
specified in the **initial_values** argument of :keyword:`run`, as a dictionary. The key for each entry must
be a Mechanism designated as `INITIALIZE_CYCLE`, and its value an input for the Mechanism to be used as its initial
value.  The size of the input (length of the outermost level if it is a list, or axis 0 if it is an np.ndarray),
must equal the number of InputStates of the Mechanism, and the size of each value must match (in number and type of
elements) that of the `variable <InputState.InputState.variable>` for the corresponding InputState.

.. _Run_Targets:

Targets
~~~~~~~

If learning is specified for a `Process <Process_Learning>` or `System <System_Execution_Learning>`, then target values
for each `TRIAL` must be provided for each `TARGET` Mechanism in the Process or System being run.  These
are specified in the **targets** argument of the :keyword:`execute` or :keyword:`run` method, which can be in
any of three formats.  The two formats used for **inputs** (`Sequence <Run_Inputs_Sequence_Format>` and
`Mechanism <Run_Inputs_Mechanism_Format>` format) can also be used for targets.  However, the format of the lists or
ndarrays is simpler, since each `TARGET` Mechanism is assigned only a single target value, so there is never the need
for the extra level of nesting (or dimension of ndarray) used for InputStates in the specification of **inputs**.
Details concerning the use of the `Sequence <Run_Targets_Sequence_Format>`  and
`Mechanism <Run_Targets_Mechanism_Format>` formats for targets is described below. Targets can also be specified
as a `function <Run_Targets_Function_Format>` (for example, to allow the target to depend on the outcome of processing).

If either the Sequence or Mechanism format is used, then the number of targets specified for each Mechanism must equal
the number specified for the **inputs** argument;  as with **inputs**, if the number of `TRIAL` \s specified is greater
than the number of inputs (and targets), then the list will be cycled until the number of `TRIAL` \s specified is
completed.  If a function is used for the **targets**, then it will be used to generate a target for each `TRIAL`.

The number of targets specified in the Sequence or Mechanism formats for each `TRIAL`, or generated using
the function format, must equal the number of `TARGET` Mechanisms for the Process or System being run (see Process
`target_mechanism <Process.Process_Base.target_mechanism>` or
System `targetMechanism <System.System_Base.target_mechanisms>` respectively), and the value of each target must
match (in number and type of elements) that  of the `target <ComparatorMechanism.ComparatorMechanism.target>`
attribute of the `TARGET` Mechanism for which it is intended.  Furthermore, if a range is specified for the output of
the `TERMINAL` Mechanism with which the target is compared (that is, the Mechanism that provides the
`ComparatorMechanism's <ComparatorMechanism>` `sample <ComparatorMechanism.ComparatorMechanism.sample>`
value, then the target must be within that range (for example, if the `TERMINAL` Mechanism is a
`TransferMechanism` that uses a `Logistic` function, its `range <TransferMechanism.TransferMechanism.range>` is
[0,1], so the target must be within that range).

.. _Run_Targets_Sequence_Format:

Sequence Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*(List[values] or ndarray):* -- there are at most three levels of nesting (or dimensions) required for
targets:  one for `TRIAL` \s, one for Mechanisms, and one for the elements of each input.  For a System
with more than one `TARGET` Mechanism, the targets must be specified in the same order as they appear in the System's
`target_mechanisms <System.System_Base.target_mechanisms>` attribute.  This should be the same order in which
they are declared, and can be displayed using the System's `show <System.System_Base.show>` method). All
other requirements are the same as the `Sequence format <Run_Inputs_Sequence_Format>` for **inputs**.

.. _Run_Targets_Mechanism_Format:

Mechanism Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*(Dict[Mechanism, List[values] or ndarray]):* -- there must be one entry in the dictionary for each of the `TARGET`
Mechanisms in the Process or System being run, though the entries can be specified in any order (making this format
easier to use. The value of each entry is a list or ndarray of the target values for that Mechanism, one for each
`TRIAL`.  There are at most two levels of nesting (or dimensions) required for each entry: one for the `TRIAL`,
and the other for the elements of each input.  In all other respects, the format is the same as the
`Mechanism format <Run_Inputs_Mechanism_Format>` for **inputs**.

.. _Run_Targets_Function_Format:

Function Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*[Function]:* -- the function must return an array with a number of items equal to the number of `TARGET` Mechanisms
for the Process or System being run, each of which must match (in number and type of elements) the
`target <ComparatorMechanism.ComparatorMechanism.target>` attribute of the `TARGET` Mechanism for which it is intended.
This format allows targets to be constructed programmatically, in response to computations made during the run.

    COMMENT

   Arguments
   ---------

    inputs : List[input] or ndarray(input) : default default_variable for a single `TRIAL`
        the input for each `TRIAL` in a sequence (see `Run_Inputs` for detailed description of formatting
        requirements and options).

    num_trials : int : default None
        the number of `TRIAL` \s to run.  If it is `None` (the default), then a number of `TRIAL` \s run will be equal
        equal to the number of items specified in the **inputs** argument.  If **num_trials** exceeds the number of
        inputs, then the inputs will be cycled until the number of `TRIAL` \s specified have been run.

    reset_clock : bool : default True
        if `True`, resets `CentralClock` to 0 before a sequence of `TRIAL` \s.

    initialize : bool default False
        calls the `initialize <System.System_Base.initialize>` method of the System prior to the first `TRIAL`.

    initial_values : Dict[Mechanism:List[input]], List[input] or np.ndarray(input) : default None
        the initial values assigned to Mechanisms designated as `INITIALIZE_CYCLE`.

    targets : List[input] or np.ndarray(input) : default None
        the target values assigned to the `ComparatorMechanism` for each `TRIAL` (used for learning).
        The length must be equal to **inputs**.

    learning : bool :  default None
        enables or disables learning during execution for a `Process <Process_Learning>` or
        `System <System_Execution_Learning>`.  If it is not specified, the current state of learning is left intact.
        If it is `True`, learning is forced on; if it is `False`, learning is forced off.

    call_before_trial : Function : default= `None`
