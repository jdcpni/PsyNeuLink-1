 # Bryn:
#  1) Programmatic creation of @property
#  2) Plug & play

# HIGH LEVEL / DESIGN / CONVENTION ISSUES:
#   1) MANAGEMENT OF RETURN_VALUE FOR MECHANISMS (AS LIST VS. 2d NP.ARRAY)
#   2) ASSIGNMENT AND NAMING OF FUNCTION_PARAMS FOR AN OBJECT;
#      PROBLEMS:
#        - CONFUSION AS TO OBJECT TO WHICH THEY BELONG (OBJECT ITSELF OR ITS FUNCTION_OBJECT)
#        - NAMING CONFLICTS
#      OPTIONS:
#        - MAKE A SPECIAL CLASS, OR KEEP function_params DICT BUT DON'T ASSIGN AS PARAMS OF OBJECT?
#        - RENAME ANY CONFLICTS WITH PREFIX "function_<param_name>" (E.G., function_learning_rate)
#        - RENAME ALL FUNCTION_PARAMS WITH PREFIX "function_<param_name>"
#        - DISALLOW CONFLICTING NAMES AND THROW EXCPETION WHEN THEY ARE DETECTED IN _instantiate_parameter_state()
#        * MAKE @property ATTRIBUTES THAT POINT TO FUNCTION'S PARAM(S)
#   3) MONITORING SPECIFICATION SYNTAX:  Restrict specification to ObjectiveMechanism and possibly ControlMechanism,
#                                        or also allow "locally" on OutputStates, Mechanisms, Processes and Systems?
#   4) SPECIFICATION OF LEARNING USING A PROJECTION SPEC VS. A DEDICATED KEYWORD (THAT ALLOWS FCT AND LEARNING_RATE)
#          PRO:  CONSISTENT WITH CONTROL
#          CON:  AKWARD TO HAVE TO GIVE THE PROJECTION THE FUNCTION AND LEARNING RATE THAT ARE PASSED TO LearningMech
#   5) SHOULD ATTRIBUTES OF PARENT CLASSED BE DOCUMENTED ON CHILD CLASSES?
#          (E.G., PREFS, NAME, FUNCTION, FUNCTON_PARAMS, USER_PARAMS, ETC.)
#   6) SHOULD WE SUPPORT >2D VALUES (PASSED ALONG PROJECTIONS, USED AS STATE VALUES, ETC.; INPUTS TO TRANSFER FCT, ETC.)
#   7) SHOULD OVERRIDE OF ATTRIBUTE SETTERS BE @PROPERTY IN CLASS DEFINITION, OR SETTER PASSED TO make_property?
#   8) • DOCUMENTATION: SHOULD WE INCLUDE COMPONENT ATTRIBUTES IN DOCSTRING FOR SUBCLASSES (E.G., params, prefs, etc.)
#   9) • DOCUMENTATION: SHOULD EXAMPLES BE GENERIC (SEE COMPONENT FUNCTION) OR SPECIFIC (USING ACTUAL PNL OBJECTS)?
#  10) DOCUMENTATION: INCLUDE EXAMPLES "INLINE" OR IN THEIR OWN SECTION AT THE END?
#  11) DOCUMENTATION: INTERNALLY-MADE ATTRIBUTE ASSIGNEMENTS SHOULD GENERALLY BE TO THE BACKFIELD (_<attrib>)
#                       TO AVOID INVOCATION OF assign_params BY PROPERTY
#                       (WHICH IS INTENDED FOR VALIDATION OF EXTERNAL ASSIGNMENTS)
#  12) • SHOULD COMPONENT NAMES HAVE SPACES OF UNDERSCORES?
#  13) • SHOULD learning_rate FOR LearningProjection SET SLOPE OF function OR DIRECTLY MULTIPLY WEIGHTS?
#  14) HOW TO HANDLE RECURRENT PROJECTIONS RE: LEARNING?
#  15) EVER ALLOW INSTANTIATION OF SENDER BY PROJECTION (OR ALWAYS RELY ON deferred_init())?
#  16) HOW TO HANDLE GATING:
#      • SPECIFICATION (WHERE AND HOW)
#      • MODULATION (WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PARAMETER_MODULATION_OPERATION:  THE STATE OR THE PROJECTION?
#      • EXECUTION:  "INLINE" (WILL INTRODUCE CYCLES IN GRAPH) OR LIKE CONTROL (PRECLUDES W/IN TRIAL GATING);
#                    EITHER WAY, HOW TO IMPLEMENT W/IN ROUND (I.E., W/IN TRIAL) GATING OF A STATE?
#                    E.G., CLASSIC CASES IN WHICH EITHER A STIMULUS GATES ITSELF INTO WM (DA)
#                          OR A DECISION INDUCES LC GATING OF RESPONSE?
#      PROPOSAL:  ALL ADAPTIVE PROJECTIONS MODULATE A PARAMETER OF THE FUNCTION OF THE STATE TO WHICH THEY PROJECT:
#                      LEARNING:  MATRIX PARAMETER STATE OF MAPPING PROJECTION (ADD / INTERCEPT)
#                      GATING:    INPUT AND OUTPUT STATE OF MECHANISM (MULTIPLY / SLOPE/GAIN)
#                      CONTROL:   PARAMETER STATE STATE OF MECHANISM (MULTIPLY / SLOPE/GAIN)
#                 NEED SOME WAY TO SPECIFY WHICH PARAMETER OF THE STATE'S FUNCTION THE MODULATORY PROJECTION MODULATES
#      ADD SUBCLASSING OF PROJECTIONS:
#                 TRANSMISSIVE (MappingProjection):  FROM PROCESSING MECHANISM
#                 ADAPTIVE (LearningProjection, GatingProjection, ControlProjection): FROM ADAPTIVE MECHANISM
#  17) State:  put integration_method as args or in params (i.e., paramClassDefaults, only on State?)

# TASKS:
#  0) IMPLEMENT: Composition
#       Assign projections for ObjectiveMechanisms, LearningMechanisms, ControlMechanisms, etc.
#       Validate that all items are in the same Composition
#       add_projection_to and add_projection_from methods
#       methods in LearningAuxilliary
#       search for "Composition" in LearningProjection, LearningMechanism and LearningAuxlliary
#       specification of ProcessingMechanism that should be associated with TARGET ObjectiveMechanism:
#             one that either has either no outgoing projections, or none that receive LearningProjections
#       got rid of special cases for Objective function altogether
#              (since comparator is just special case of derivative = 0)
#       added attribute to Projections:  has_learning_projection
#  1) BREAK UP FUNCTION INTO SEPARATE MODULES
#  2) IMPLEMENT CLASSES FOR ALL KEYWORDS (SIMILAR TO MatrixKeywords)
#  4) IMPLEMENT ABC
# 4a) IMPLEMENT Swap execute (on Mechanism) and _execute (on its subclasses)
# 4b) IMPROVE API FOR MECHANISMS
#  5) IMPLEMENT Compilation / paralleliztion of execution

# 11) IMPLEMENT Production System model (using scheduler??)
# 12) IMPLEMENT LEABRA
# 14) IMPLEMENT Model fitting
# 15) IMPLEMENT Statefulness:  Integrators, ControlSignal.intensity, ?Gating, Learning?

#            `delta` property that returns value - previous_value (done on TransferMechanism as example)

# COMMENT


# DOCUMENTATION: items in paramClassDefaults are created as attributes (not properties), and are thus not validated
#                    when assignments are made to them;  items in user_params are created as properties, and are
#                    validated (via assign_params) when assignments are made to them.
# DOCUMENTATION:  assign_args_to_params_dicts should be used for any attributes for which parameterStates can be created
# DOCUMENTATION:  Now that attribute assignment calls:
#                         _assign_params, which in turn calls _instantiate_params, which in turn calls _validate_params
#                             therefore _validate params may only get a subset of the params for a component
#                                in which case it can't be used to insure that a given param has been implemented,
#                                only that its value is a syntactically legal one.
#                                enforcement of assignment should be done using required_params
#                         in general, _validate_params should now check that the parameter being validated
#                             is in the target_set

# DOCUMENTATION: Component._validate_params:  if testing before call to super, use request_set
#                                             if testing after call to super, use target_set

# DOCUMENTATION:
#   *** PUT IN InputState AND OutputState DOCUMENTATION
#
#   Gating can be also be specified for an `InputState` or `OutputState` when it is created
#     in any of the following ways:
#
#     * in a 2-item tuple, in which the first item is a `state specification <LINK>`,
#       and the second item is a `gating specification <>`
#
#     * keywords GATE (==GATE_PRIMARY) GATE_ALL, GATE_PRIMARY
#         or an entry in the state specification dictionary with the key "GATING", and a value that is the
#         keyword TRUE/FALSE, ON/OFF, GATE, a ModulationOperation value, GatingProjection, or its constructor
#
# DOCUMENTATION: parameters always return the value of their parameterState if they have one
#                (tested in getter for property)
#                   in order to insure that any modulation (control/learning) has beeen applied
#                Do this in definition of property (using backfield as "base_vale")
# DOCUMENTATION: modulation argument/attribute in ControlSignal and GatingSignal
# DOCUMENTATION: ModulatoryMechanism: describe how they work, i.e., that they assign the value of their
#                  outputState to the paraemter of the state's function specified in their modulation param
# DOCUMENTATION: State functions: must be TransferFunction or CombinationFunction, and implement meta mod params
# DOCUMENTATION: State: use of integration function to implement persistence
# DOCUMENTATION: GatingSignal (per ControlSignal) -- describe modulation in both
# DOCUMENTATION: Various forms of specification;  if Mechainsm: assume primary InputState
# DOCUMENTATION: STATE FUNCTIONS MUST ALWAYS BE A TransferFunction
# DOCUMENTATION: UPDATE ParameterState_Parameter_Modulation_Operation WITH REFACTORING OF modulation arg/param
# DOCUMENTATION: UPDATE ControlSignal to describe modulation attribute (as in GatingSignal)
# DOCUMENTATION: ADD ENTRIES FOR variable, function, vaue, params, name and prefs to GatingMechanism and ControlMechaism
# DOCUMENTATION: GatingMechanism:  ADD TO docstring [AND DO SAME IN ControlMechanism and LearningMechanism]
#             this means that the GatingMechanism's function must return as many items as it has GatingSignals,
#             with each item of the function's value used by a corresponding GatingSignal.
#             Note: multiple GatingProjections can be assigned to the same GatingSignal to achieve "divergent gating"
#                   (that is, gating of many states with a single value -- e.g., LC)
# DOCUMENTATION: revise LearningMechanism docstring to include output_state attribute, and describe situation with
#                    (multiple possible) LearningSignal entries, their relatioship to learing_signal attribute, and
#                    the ERROR_SIGNAL OutputState.
# DOCUMENTATION: add output_states to attribute in docstring for ControlMechanism and GatingMechanism
# DOCUMENTATION: add section on LearningSignals to LearningMechanism docstring:
#                   note that default (and most common case) is for a single LearningSignal
#                   that projections to the parmaeterState for the MATRIX parameter of a MappingProjection,
# DOCUMENTATION: upgrade LearningSignal's learning_rate description (mention how it affect ParameterState's function)
# DOCUMENTATION: can instantiate LearningSignal w/o LearningProjections:
#                    creates a default LearningSignal, along with ERROR output_state

#                (use function recursively to perform the hadamard modulation)
#                if hadamard params are specified, use them as template to determine shape of items in variable
#                   (so that a single item can be passed to be modulate, as per LearningProjection)

#                 if EVC == EVC_max: (LINE 289 IN EVCAuxilliary)

# FIX: execution_token asynchrony:
#    * Since learning and controller execute after processing mechanisms:
#      - on the first pass, they ignore learning and control projections (since their excxecution_tokens == None
#      - on subsequent passes, they have the new (current) execution_token, while learning and control mechanisms
#             still have the last one
#      SOLUTION:  HAVE LEARNING AND CONTROL MECHANISMS GET THEIR execution_tokens FROM THEIR SYSTEM?
#                 OR HAVE SYSTEM ASSIGN ITS LEARNING AND CONTROL MECHANISMS THE CURRENT execution_token??
#      SOLUTION:  ASSIGN execution_token TO ALL MECHANISMS IN SYSTEM GRAPH AND LEARNING GRAPH AT TIME OF SYSTEM EXEC.
#
#    * Same issue for learning in Process??

# It’s helpful if methods that mutate object state have names that suggest they will do so.
#      For example, it was confusing to me that _validate_variable assigns self.variable and self.variableClassDefault
#      (at least it does in Mechanism, I’m not sure about other subclasses).  I was expecting it simply to validate,
#      as in do nothing if the variable was OK, and throw an exception if it wasn’t.
#      It may sound kooky, but even a clunky name like “validate_and_set_variable” would be better,
#      or better still would be to make validate really just validate,
#      and have another method like “assign_variable” or something.
# In general, every assignment statement changes the behavior of the program in ways that are non-local,
#      and thus hard to understand and debug. So you want as few of them as you can possibly get away with,
#      and you want them clearly identified.
# NotImplemented is used a lot for missing arguments. Usually people use None for that.
#     This also allows for a nice idiom. Given a parameter foo = None, you can do defaulting like this:
#     myval = foo or “some default value”
#     So you get myval = foo if foo is truthy (not None, [], (), 0, 0.0, “”, or False), and your default value otherwise
# I don’t think you have to worry quite so much about people implementing classes wrongly or subversively.
#     This is Python - if they want to do bad things, you’ll be hard pressed to stop them.
#     All you can do is guide them in the right direction.
# In Function there’s a test to make sure there’s a registry - this probably ought to be handled by having
#     a base class “Category” or something, that ensures there is one in its __init__, and just insisting that
#     every category class extends that “Category” class. We can talk more about this.
# Normally when implementing __init__, it’s a good idea for base classes to call super().__init__ first,
#     before doing anything else. In some languages, e.g. C++ and Java, it’s actually required to be the first thing.
#     There were some comments in Function.__init__ that made me think you’re expecting people to do some setup before
#     calling super().__init__.
# Automated type checking (like typecheck-decorator) would reduce code size noticeably.

#     Method names, e.g. verbosePref -> verbose_pref in ComponentPreferenceSet
#     Aim for methods that fit on a single screen, e.g. Function.__init__ is about 150 lines,
#         but you want something like 50 lines for a method for it to be comprehensible.
#     Along the same lines, too many #regions, and too much SHOUTING. Breaks up the reader’s flow.
#     Single line comments in normal case are fine.
#     No need for #regions around 1-2 lines of code, especially if your region name almost exactly matches
#         the name of the method you’re calling in the region (e.g. Function, around the end of __init__)
#     For each #region more than 2-3 lines long, consider whether it would be better to extract that code to
#         a small helper method or function.
# Commenting style:
#     Want comments on each method, not one block at the class level that lists all the methods.
#     Documentation generators like sphinx will generate those class summaries from component parts,
#         no need to synthesize them yourself
#     Guiding principle: docs as physically close to the code as possible, so less likely to get out of sync.
#     No point in listing things like “:param level: and :return:” if they’re not actually going to be documented,
#         it’s just taking up space.
#     Lots of code commented out. Just delete it, git will get it back for you if you decide you need it again.
#     Use doc strings to document class members, not comments
#         (e.g. Function.py line ~207 doc for variableClassDefault_Locked)

# QUESTION:     Should ControlSignal "intelligence" (e.g., intensity, costs, etc.)
#                   be in EVC mechanism rather than ControlProjection?
#                   EVCMechanism makes more sense theoretically
#                      e.g., seems better to talk about the cost of a control signal, rather than ControlProjection
#                   Projection is easier to manage (as it is its own object, can be parameterized, etc.)
#                   Maybe they should be assigned to OutputStates of the EVCMechanism?

# FIX: PROCESS INPUT, AND TARGET INPUT TO ComparatorMechanism, ARE RESTRICTED TO PROCESS TO WHICH MECHANISM BELONGS
#      ?SHOULD SAME BE TRUE FOR ALL PROJECTIONS:  ONLY UPDATE THOSE BELONGING TO MECHANISMS WITHIN THE PROCESS?

# QUESTION: When executing a mechanism, and updating its projections (to get their input),
#               should update only those from mechanisms that belong to the process currently being executed?
#               or should all projections be updated (irrespective of source) when executing a mechanism?
#           This issue includes Process inputs, as well as target inputs
#           Inclined to only restrict Process and target inputs
#           (since those are process-specific) but not other projections
#
# QUESTION: RL:
#       Option 1 - Provide Process with reward for option selected: more natural, but introduces timing problems:
#           - how to provide reward for outcome of first trial, if it is selected probabilistically
#           - must process trial, get reward from environment, then execute learning
#           SOLUTION: use lambda function to assign reward to outputState of terminal mechanism
#       Option 2 - Provide Process with reward vector, and let targetMechanism choose reward based on action vector
#           - softamx should pass vector with one non-zero element, that is the one rewarded by comoparator
#           SOLUTION:  use this for Process, and implement Option 1 at System level (which can control timing):
#           - system should be take functions that specify values to use as inputs based on outputs
#               as per SOLUTION to Option 1 using lambda functions

# QUESTION: Default object (e.g., default_projection for Process): should they be templates or objects?
#                                                                  or signify (e.g., class = template)

# QUESTION: ??OPTION (reshapedWeightMatrixOption for MappingProjection) TO SUPPRESS RESHAPING (FOR FULL CONNECTIVITY)
#
# QUESTION: WHICH CLASS SHOULD HANDLE THE EXECUTION OF LEARNING:  PROCESS OR SYSTEM
#           Process:
#               - it manages the instantiation of LearningSignals
#               - part of the definition of a Process: output is where supervised training signals are provided
#               - may want to build a model that can learn and only has a Process
#           System:
#               - need to manage execution of learning in systems anyhow (same as for mechanisms)
#               - learning that needs to straddle Processes
#                   (e.g., error-signals that need to be passed from the first layer of one Process
#                    to the last layer of a preceding Process) - but then make them one Process (per definition above)?
#
# FIX: HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT THAN LENGTH OF self.variable
#         + kwTransfer_NUnits (float): (default: Transfer_DEFAULT_NUNITS
#             specifies number of units (length of input array)
#
# NEED FOR EVC MODEL:
# - Sequential adjust effects:
#   "Reactive":  simple ControlMechanism that maps input values into ControlProjection intensities
#   "Simple Exhaustive Search": find optimal policy for stimulus/reward values
#   "Feature-based model learning" (Falk & Tom)
#   "Exhaustive Search + learning":
#       searches through all ControlSignals to find the optimal one
#       stimulus prediction
#       reward prediction
#       automatic component of the drift for each stimulus (== weight matrix)
#    *  d(parameter_value)/d(control signal intensity) for each control signal ==
#                                                          differential of the parameterModulationFunction
#       NOTE:
#          THIS IS DISTINCT FROM THE ControlProjection.function
#                                           (== intensity_function) WHICH MAPS ALLCATION -> ControlProjection Intensity

# FIX: execute VS. update

#      WOULD BE BETTER AND MORE CONSISTENT TO HAVE THEM IMPLEMENT update() WHICH CALLS .execute
#      PROBLEM with implementing update() in subclasses of Mechanism:
#          1) it would override Mechanism.update so must call super().update
#          2) no obvious place to do so, since execute() (which MUST be implemented by subclass)
#                 is called in the MIDDLE of Mechanism.update
#          3) could name subclass.update() something else, but that gets more complicated
#      PROBLEM with NOT implementing update() in subclasses of Mechanism:
#          1) they are now special (i.e., not treated like all other classes in Function hierarchy)
#          2) all of the "housekeeping" for execution must be done in subclass.execute()
#          3) that means that kwExecute can't be used to override self.execute (i.e., defeats plug and play)
#      CURRENT SOLUTION:
#          use FUNCTION as scripting interface
#          intercept specification of FUNCTION before _instantiate_function (e.g., in _validate_params),

#                  2) EVCMechanism - new version that takes output of MonitoringMechanism, and just handles search.
#                  3) ControlProjection - as it is now.
#
#            Learning: 1) MonitoringMechanism - use relevant one, as it does now.
#                      2) LearningMechanism - move BP and RL implementations from LearningProjection to this/these;
#                                               takes output of MonitoringMechanism (as errorSignal)
#                                               as well as an errorSource as its input
#                                               (rather than figuring it out, as it does now);

# DOCUMENT: SYSTEM:
#           ORIGIN: origin mechanism of a process in a system that does not receive projections from any other mechanisms
#                   NOTE: if a mechanism that is an origin for one process, but also appears as an INTERNAL mechanism
#                         in another process, it is NOT treated as an origin in the system;
#           INTERNAL: mechanism both receives projections from and sends projections to other mechanisms in the system
#           INITIALIZE_CYCLE: mechanism that has an outgoing projection that closes a cycle (feedback loop),
#                       so it should be properly initialized
#                       NOTE: self.executionGraph elides the projection that closes the loop so that an acyclic graph can be
#                             constructed to generate an execution list / sequence;  however, the projection is
#                             still operational in the system and will support recurrent (feedback) processing)
#           TERMINAL: terminal mechanism of a process that does not project to any other processing mechanisms
#                     (however, it can project to a ControlMechanism or a MonitoringMechanism)
#
# DOCUMENT: PROCESS:
#           If either the sender and/or receiver arg of a MappingProjection are not specified,
#               initialization of the projection is delayed.  This has the following consequence:
#           If the MappingProjection is defined outside the Process pathway and not explicitly listed in it,
#               it will not be included in the Process;  this is because deferring intialization means that
#               even if the sender or the receiver is specified, the projection will not be assigned to the
#               specified mechanism's projection list (efferents, afferents), and thus not
#               identified in _instantiate_pathway.  Could allow sender to be left unspecified and still
#               proceed with initialization that thus be recognized by the Process;  however, can't do the reverse
#               (specify sender but not receiver) since receiver *must* be specified to initialize a projection
#               this assymetry might be confusing, and thus neither is allowed
#           However, if projection is listed in pathway, it is not necessary to specify its sender or receiver

#                     - include the function's arg as args in __init__
#                         (since there is only one set (no confusion of which belong to which of the possible functions)
#                          and it is more convenient than having to specify the function in order to specify its params)
#                     - package the args in function_args in _assign_args_to_param_dicts()
#                 if there is MORE than one value for the function:
#                     - include it as arg in __init__()
#                          (since there are different options)
#                     - do NOT include its args in __init__()
#                          (since some might be inappropriate for some functions)
#                     - they should be declared inside the definition of the function in the function arg
#
# DOCUMENT: Function Components don't use functionParams (i.e., they are the end of the recursive line)

# DOCUMENT: function, execute & update
#            .execute should be called to execute all object classes (except States):
#                it takes care of any "house-keeping" before and after it calls .function (if it exsits)
#                .execute should always return an array, the first item of which is the return value of .function
#                (note: System and Process don't implement a separate .function; it points to .execute)
#                Subclasses of mechanism implement _execute that is called by Mechanism
#                    - this is so Mechanism base class can do housekeeping before and after subclass._execute)
#                    - if a subclass does not implement _execute, calling it will call .function directly
#                    -  if INITIALIZING is in context for call to execute, initMethod is checked to determine whether:
#                        subclass._execute (but NOT Mechanism.execute) is run (initMethod = INIT__EXECUTE__METHOD_ONLY)
#                        ONLY subclass.function is run (initMethod = INIT_FUNCTION_METHOD_ONLY)
#                              (EXAMPLE: EVCMechanism -- don't want to run full simulation during init)
#                        full subclass._execute and Mechanism.execute method are run
#                States use .execute only to call .function (during init);  they are updated using <state>.update()
#            .function is the "business end" of the object:
#                - generally it is a Function object
#                - but can be anything that adheres to the Function API

# DOCUMENT: Construction/Initialization Implementation:
# 1) Function implements _deferred_init(), which checks whether self.init_status is InitStatus.DEFERRED_INITIALIZATION;
#     if so, calls super(<subclass>,self).__init__(**self.init_args)
#     <subclass> is the class implementing deferred initialization
#     <**self.init_args> is the set of args passed to the __init__() method of the subclass
# 2) an object can defer initialization by doing the following in its __init__ method: (see LearningProjection for example)
#     - storing its args as follows:
#         self.init_args = locals().copy()
#         self.init_args['context'] = self
#         self.init_args['name'] = name
#         del self.init_args['self']
#     - set self.init_status = InitStatus.DEFERRED_INITIALIZATION
# 3) Where projections are ordinarily instantiated, assign instantiated stub" to efferents,
# 4) When a process is instantiated, the last thing it does is call _deferred_init
#    for all of the projections associated with the mechanism in its pathway,
#    beginning with the last and moving backward though the pathway
# 5) When finally instantiating deferred projections, be sure to do validation of their variable with sender's output:
#          State._instantiate_state:  elif iscompatible(self.variable, projection_spec.value):
# 6) update() method should test for self.value and if it is DEFERRED_INITIALIZATION it should return self.value
# 7) Objects that call execute method of ones with deferred init should test for return value of DEFERRED_INITIALIZATION
#     and handle appropriately


# DOCUMENT: LEARNING
#  Principles:
# - learning occurs on processes (i.e., it has no meaning for an isolated mechanism or projection)
# - Initialization of LearningSignals should occur only after a process has been instantiated (use _deferred_init)
# - Reorder the instantiation process:
#    - _instantiate_receiver
#    - _instantiate_sender
#    - _instantiate_function
#
#  LearningProjection requires that:
#               - _instantiate_sender and _instantiate_receiver be called in reverse order,
#               - some of their elements be rearranged, and
#               - MappingProjection.instantiate_parameter_state() be called in MappingProjection._instantiate_attributes_after_function
#               this is because:
#               - _instantiate_sender needs to know whether or not a MonitoringMechanism already exists
#                   which means it needs to know about the LearningProjection's receiver (MappingProjection)
#                   that it uses to find the ProcessingMechanism being monitored (error_source)
#                   which, in turn, means that _instantiate_receiver has to have already been called
#               - _instantiate_sender must know size of weight matrix to check compatibilit of error_signal with it
#           Error Signal "sits" in Monitoring mechanim that is the sender for the LearningProjection
#  MonitoringMechanism must implement and update flag that indicates errorSignal has occured
#           this is used by MappingProjection to decide whether to update LearningProjection & weight matrix

# DOCUMENT: CONVERSION TO NUMPY AND USE OF self.value
#    - self.value is the lingua franca of (and always) the output of an function
#           Mechanisms:  value is always 2D np.array (to accomodate multiple states per Mechanism
#           All other Function objects: value is always 1D np.array
#    - Mechanism.value is always an indexible object of which the first item is a 1D np.array
#               (corresponding to the value of Mechanism.outputState and Mechanism.outputStates.items()[0]
#     Mechanism.variable[i] <-> Mechanism.input_state.items()e[i]
#     Mechanism.value[i] <-> Mechanism.ouptputState.items()e[i]
#    - variable = input, value = output
#    - Function.variable and Function.value are always converted to 2D np.ndarray
#             (never left as number, or 0D or 1D array)
#             [CLEAN UP CODE THAT TESTS FOR OTHERWISE] - this accomodate the possiblity of multiple states,
#                 each of which is represented by a 1D array in variable and value
#             Whenever self.value is set, should insure it is a 2D np.ndarray
#             output of projections should always be 1D array, since each corresponds to a single state
#     variable AND Mechanism output specification:
#     [0, 1, 2] (i.e., 1D array) => one value for the object
#                                (e.g., input state for a MappingProjection, or param value for a ControlProjection)

# PROBLEM: By allowing specification of an arg to be an object,

#              (although is inefficient: have to instantiate each twice -- particularly salient for Matlab-based ones)
#              but what about other object types (e.g., projections), that might be explicitly instantiated for
#              use in one or more places, or created in one place and used in another (e.g., projections for a Process);
#              such items should/would be usable as templates but not actual objects
#          ??SOLUTIONS:
#              - add attribute that determines whether the object should be used an instance or a template?
#                ?? which should be the default behavior?
#              - determine use by context:  items created inline for args = templates;  assigned items = instances??

#                     OR

#            NOTE: THIS ONLY WORKS IF eval(kwSomeParam) (== some_param) is an arg for someFunction
#                  (i.e.:  def someFunction(some_param=some_default_value))
#                  FOR FUNCTION THAT MUST ACCEPT PARAMS NOT SPECIFIED AS ARGS, THEN INCLUDE **kwargs AS ARG
#                  AND THEN PASS kwargs TO _assign_args_to_param_dicts as params:
#                  _assign_args_to_param_dicts(params=kwargs)
#                  any entries that have keys matching an arg of someFunction will be assigned to the corresponding args

#                      will be left in kwargs, and passed to assign_args_as_param_dicts() in the params dict

# IMPLEMENT: @property for FUNCTION_PARAMS that parses tuple vs. direct value
#            (replace existing function in ParameterStates)
#
#  _validate_function:

# FIX / IMPLEMENT: Make sure that if function is reassigned (.e.g, using _instantiate_defaults),
# FIX:                  that function_params are changed too
#

#       CURRENTLY FUNCTIONING ("NEW" - 11/27/16, AS OF 11/29/16)
#       SHOULD BE MODIFIED SO THAT FUNCTION PARAMS ARE KEPT ONLY IN, AND ACCESSED DIRECTLY FROM

#           AN @PROPERTY FOR function_params TO GET THEM or
#           POINT user_params.function_params TO THEM (rather than it being a dict)
#
# FIX: _validate_params ALWAYS ALLOW PARAMETER_STATE_PARAMS TO PASS
# FIX: get rid of is_numeric_or_none; replace throughout with tc.optional(is_numeric)
# FIX: implement _instantiate_defaults where flagged
#
# QUESTION: is it possible to specify a function param in a params dict if the arguments appear in the __init__
#           method?  And, in either case, does specifying function params in a params dict overrided the value
#           assigned in an explicit instantation of the function in function arg of the __init__ method?
# QUESTION: does a parameter dict have to put projection params in a PROJECTION_PARAMS subdictionary, or can it
#           it simply include entries for the params along with (i.e., at the same level as) the PROJECTION_TYPE entry
#
# IMPLEMENT: is_numeric_or_none -> optional_numeric
#
# FIX: CHANGE PROCESSING MECHANISMS TO USE update RATHER THAN execute, AND TO IMPLEMENT FUNCTION
# FIX: For SUBTYPES, change funtionType to functionSubType (may interacat with naming)
# IMPLEMENT:
#     Move code specific to _deferred_init from sublass.__init__() to Function.__init__() (MODIFIED 8/14/16 NEW)
#     PROBLEM: variable is called variable_default in Function, and params is param_defaults
#              but something different in subclasses, so not recognized; need to standardize across all classes
# IMPLEMENT: MODIFY SO THAT self.execute (IF IT IS IMPLEMENTED) TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER FUNCTION
#                 BUT CALLS IT BY DEFAULT);  EXAMPLE:  IntegratorMechanism
# IMPLEMENT:  change specification of params[FUNCTION] from class to instance (as in ControlProjection functions)
# IMPLEMENT:  change _validate_variable (and all overrides of it) to:
#              _validate_variable(request_value, target_value, context)
#              to parallel _validate_params, and then:
# IMPLEMENT: some mechanism to disable instantiating ParameterStates for parameters of an function
#                that are specified in the script
#            (e.g., for EVC.function:
#                - uses LinearCombination,
#                - want to be able to specify the parameters for it
#                - but do not need any parameterStates assigned to those parameters
#            PROBLEMS:
#                - specifying parameters invokes instantation of parameterStates
#                    (note: can avoid parameterState instantation by not specifying parameters)
#                - each parameterState gets assigned its own functions, with the parameter as its variable
#                - the default function for a parameterState is LinearCombination (using IDENTITY_MATRIX)
#                - that now gets its own parameters as its variables (one for each parameterState)
#                - it can't handle kwOperaton (one of its parameters) as its variable!
#            SOLUTION:
#                - FUNCTION_PARAMS: {PARAMETER_STATE: None}}:  suppresses ParameterStates
#                - handled in Mechanism._instantiate_parameter_states()
#                - add DOCUMENTATION in Components and/or Mechanisms or ParameterStates;
#                      include note that functionParams are still accessible in paramsCurrent[functionParams]
#                      there are just not any parameterStates instantiated for them
#                          (i.e., can't be controlled by projections, etc.)
#                - TBI: implement instantiation of any specs for parameter states provided in PARAMETER_STATES
#
# Implement: recursive checking of types in _validate_params;
# Implement: type lists in paramClassDefaults (akin requiredClassParams) and use in _validate_params
            # IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
            #    - currently no checking of compatibility for entries in embedded dicts
            #    - add once paramClassDefaults includes type lists (as per requiredClassParams)
# Implement categories of Function functions using ABC:
# - put checks for constraints on them (e.g., input format = output format)
# - associate projection and state categories with function categories:
#    e.g.:  mapping = transform;  input & output states = aggregate

#     EVERY MECHANISM UPDATES EVERY STEP
#     BUT IT DOES SO WITH SCALE = 1/FREQ
#
# Update Cycle:
#     Each Process calls update method of each mechanism in its pathway
#     Mechanisms are called in reverse order so that updating is synchronous
#         (i.e., updating of each mechanism is indpendent of the influence of any others in a feed-forward chain)
#     Each mechanism:
#         - updates its inputState(s) by calling its projection(s)
#             - projections are updated and values included in inputState update based on projection's timing param
#         - runs its execute method
#         - updates its outputState(s)
#
# TimeScale params:
#     Number of timesteps per trial (default:  100??)
#
# ProjectionTiming params [ProjectionTiming namedtuple: (phase, frequency, scale)]
#     Phase (time_steps): determines when update function starts relative to start of run
#     Frequency (int [>0] or float [0-1]): cycle time for projection's contribution to updating of inputState.variable:
#                               - if int, updates every <int> time_steps
#                               - if float, multiplied times self.value and used to update every cycle
#     Scale (float [0-1]):  scales projection's contribution to inputState.variable
#                            (equivalent to rate constant of time-averaged net input)
#     Function (UpdateMode):  determines the shape of the cycling function;
#                             - default is delta function:  updates occur only on time_steps modulo frequency
#                             - future versions should add other functions
#                               (e.g,. square waves and continuous function to "temporally smooth" update function
# LATEST VERSION:
#   - phaseSpec for each Mechanism in Process::
#        integers:
#            specify time_step (phase) on which mechanism is updated (when modulo time_step == 0)
#                - mechanism is fully updated on each such cycle
#                - full cycle of System is largest phaseSpec value
#        floats:
#            values to the left of the decimal point specify the "cascade rate":
#                the fraction of the outputvalue used as the input to any projections on each (and every) time_step
#            values to the right of the decimal point specify the time_step (phase) at which updating begins

#region STATE: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# FIX: WHY IS THE FIRST ARGUMENT FOR A State (AND ITS SUBCLASSES) "value" RATHER THAN "variable"??
#
# FIX: OutputState:  value as arg and value as attribute are different and therefore confusing;
#                    rename reference_value??
# IMPLEMENT: full _instantiate_input_states capability per _instantiate_output_states (see ObjectiveMechanism):
#                 ??include `senders` arg (and use version of _get_monitored_states in EVC)
# IMPLEMENT: OutputState.update: INCORPORATE paramModulationOperation HERE, AS PER PARAMETER STATE
# IMPLEMENT: REPLACE INDEXING OF Mechanism.value by OUTPUTSTATES WITH NAMES OF ITEMS IN Mechanism.value
# FIX: ``value`` should not be used as the name of the variable arg for states
#              too easily confused with their ``value`` attributes;  should be switched back to ``variable``
# IMPLEMENT: ``index`` attribute for InputState, paralleling outputState (and document accordingly)
#
# IMPLEMENT: OutputStates:
#               _instantiate_output_states() (~Lines 587-602):
#                          if the number of states in owner.paramsCurrent[OUTPUT_STATES] matches
#                          the len of axis 0 of owner_value, then the default should be to increment
#                          index for each state, assigining each item of owner_value to each outputState
#                          (seems natural);  if the lengths are not equal, then can use current default
#                          behavior which is to assign the value of all the outputStates to the first item
#                          of owner_value
#
# IMPLEMENT: OutputStates:
    # COMMENT:
    #     OutputStates can also be added by using the :py:func:`assign_output_state <OutputState.assign_output_state>`.
    # COMMENT
#
# FIX:  Generalize solution to problem of combining projection values when they are matrices:
#       Currently solved by embedding the value of a projection to a matrix parameterState of a MappingProjection
#           in a list (see "is_matrix_mapping").  Should probably do some more general check on dimensionality
#           of value and/or coordinate this with (e.g,. specify relevant parameter for) LinearCombination function
#
# IMPLEMENT:  OutputState functions (per following from DOCUMENTATION under Mechanism docsring:
#    Usually the ``function`` of the primary outputState transfers the result of the mechanism's function to the primary
#    outputState's ``value`` attribute (i.e., its function is the Linear function with slope=1 and intercept=0).  Other
#    outputStates may use other functions to transform the result of the mechanism's function in various ways (e.g.,
#    generate its mean, variance, etc.)
#
# IMPLEMENT outputStateParams dict;  SEARCH FOR: [TBI + OUTPUT_STATE_PARAMS: dict]
# IMPLEMENT: ability to redefine primary input and output states (i.e., to be other than the first)
#
# IMPLEMENT:  ?? ADD OPTION TO OVERRIDE "LAZY UPDATING" OF PARAMETER STATES, SO THAT ANY CHANGES CAN BE SEEN IN A PRINT
#                STATEMENT AS SOON AS THEY HAVE OCCURRED)
# IMPLEMENT: ADD OPTION TO SPECIFY WHICH OUTPUT STATES (self.output_values) TO INCLUDE IN REPORT_OUTPUT
#            (e.g., DDM)
# IMPLEMENT:  ParamsDict - > .<param>:
#             In update parameter states, assign self.param.value == parameterState[<param>].value
#                                         and use those in mechanism functions (as current value of parameters)
#             Implement same pattern for inputState and outputState dicts, so that can have: inputState.name.value
# IMPLEMENT: option to override "lazy updating" of parameterStates (and, in particular, weight matrix)
#            -> useful for debugging;  confusing to have updates not appear until next trial
# *** NEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS (in State, below):
# IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:  This is where a default projection would be implemented
#                       if params = NotImplemented or there is no param[PROJECTIONS]

# PROBLEM: [FIXED PER BELOW]
#    - _instantiate_sender must know error_source, to know whether or not to instantiate a monitoring mechanism;
#        this reqiures access to LearningProjection's receiver, and thus that _instantiate_receiver be called first;
#    - that means instantiating receiver before the execute method of the MappingProjection has been instantiated
#        which, in turn, means that the weight matrix has not been instantiated
#    - that is a problem for _instantiate_sender, as there is no way to validate that
#        the length of the error_signal from the LearningProjection.sender is compatible with the dim of the weight matrix
#
# IMPLEMENT: NEW DESIGN:
#
# 0) Make sure MappingProjection from terminal Mechanism in Process is to ComparatorMechanism using IDENTITY_MATRIX
#    In System terminal mechanism search, don't include MonitoringMechanisms
#
# 1) LearningProjection:
#    - _instantiate_receiver:
#        - MappingProjection
#    - _instantiate_sender:
#        - examine mechanism to which MappingProjection project (receiver) projects:  self.receiver.owner.receiver.owner
#            - check if it is a terminal mechanism in the system:
#                - if so, assign:
#                    - ComparatorMechanism ErrorMonitoringMechanism
#                        - ProcessInputState for ComparatorMechanism (name it??) with projection to target inputState
#                        - MappingProjection from terminal ProcessingMechanism to LinearCompator sample inputState
#                - if not, assign:
#                    - WeightedErrorMechanism ErrorMonitoringMechanism
#                        - MappingProjection from preceding ErrorMonitoringMechanism:
#                            preceding processing mechanism (ppm):
#                                ppm = self.receiver.owner.receiver.owner
#                            preceding processing mechanism's output projection (pop)
#                                pop = ppm.outputState.projections[0]
#                            preceding processing mechanism's output projection learning signal (popls):
#                                popls = pop.parameterState.path_afferents[0]
#                            preceding ErrorMonitoringMechanism (pem):
#                                pem = popls.sender.owner
#                            assign MappingProjection from pem.outputState to self.input_state
#                        - Get weight matrix for pop (pwm):
#                                pwm = pop.parameterState.params[MATRIX]
#    - update: compute weight changes based on errorSignal received rom ErrorMonitor Mechanism and pwm
#
# 2) ErrorMonitoring Mechanism:
#    - get MappingProjection from source of errorSignal:
#        last one (associated with terminal ProcessingMechanism) gets it from external input
#        preceding ones (associated with antecedent ProcessingMechanisms in the Process) get it from
#            the ErrorMonitor associated with the next ProcessingMechanism in the process:
#    - get weightMatrix for the output of its associated ProcessingMechanism
#        last one:  this should be identityMatrix (for MappingProjection from terminal mechanism to ComparatorMechanism)
#        preceding ones: get from self.receiver.owner.outputState.projections.params[MATRIX]
#    - ErrorMonitoring Mechanism computes the error for each element of its variable ("activation vector"):
#        last one (LinearCompartor) simply computes difference between its two inputs (target and sample)
#        preceding ones compute it as the dot product of its input (errorSignal) and weightMatrix
#    - outputState (errorSignal) has two projections:
#         one MappingProjection to the preceding ErrorMonitorMechanism
#         one LearningProjection to the output MappingProjection of its associated ProcessingMechanism
#
#
# 3) Update:
#    ?? add to System?
#    ?? use toposort?
#    ?? coordinate with updating for Mechanisms?
#
# Two object types:
# 1) ComparatorMechanism (MonioringMechanism):
#     - has two input_states:  i) system output;  ii) training input
#     - computes some objective function on them (default:  Hadamard difference)
#     - default ComparatorMechanism that is associated with default LearningProjection
#
# 2) LearnningSignal (Projection):
#     - sender:  output of Monitoring Mechanism
#         default: receiver.owner.outputState.efferents.<MonitoringMechanism> if specified,
#                  else default ComparatorMechanism
#     - receiver: MappingProjection parameterState (or some equivalent thereof)
#
# Need to add parameterState to Projection class;  composition options:
#    - use ParameterState
#    - extract core functionality from ParameterState:
#        make it an object of its own
#        ParameterState and Training Projection both call that object
# MappingProjection should have LEARNING_PARAM which:
#    - specifies LearningProjection
#    - uses self.outputStates.efferents.<MonitoringMechanism> if specified
#    - otherwise defaults to LinearCompartor (which it instantiates for itself) and LearningProjection with BP
#
# Projection mechanism:
# Generalized delta rule:
# weight = weight + (learningRate * errorDerivative * transferDerivative * sampleSender)
# for sumSquared error function:  errorDerivative = (target - sample)
# for logistic activation function: transferDerivative = sample * (1-sample)
# NEEDS:
# - errorDerivative:  get from FUNCTION of ComparatorMechanism
# - transferDerivative:  get from FUNCTION of Process Processing Mechanism
#
# LearningProjection instantiation
# QUESTION: which should be the sender for final LearningProjection in a Process (and compute the initial errorSignal):
#             - a MonitoringMechanism to which the output (terminal) layer projects
#                  ADVANTAGES:
#                    - modular, consistent with PNL "philosophy"
#                  PROBLEMS:
#                    - the MonitoringMechanism masks the output layer as the terminal mechanism of the Process
#             - the output (terminal) layer of a process
#                  in this case, the targetMechanism would receive a projection from the output layer,
#                     and project the errorSignal back to it, which would then be assigned to outputLayer.errorSignal
#                  ADVANTAGES:
#                    - keeps the errorSignal exclusively in the ProcessingMechanism
#                  PROBLEMS:
#                    - overspecialization (i.e., less modular)
#                    - need to deal with recurrence in the System graph
#                    - as above, the MonitoringMechanism masks the output layer as the terminal mechanism of the Process
#             - output layer itself (i.e., make a special combined Processing/MonitoringMechanism subclass) that has
#                  two input states (one for processing input, another for training signal, and a targetMechanism method)
#                  ADVANTAGES:
#                    - more compact/efficient
#                    - no recurrence
#                    - errorSignal resides in ProcessingMechanism (as with all other levels)
#                    - leaves the output layer is the terminal mechanism of the Process
#                  PROBLEMS:
#                    - overspecialization (i.e., less modular)
#                    - needs additional "function" (targetMechanism function)

# IMPLEMENT: LEARNING IN Processes W/IN A System; EVC SHOULD SUSPEND LEARNING DURING ITS SIMULATION RUN
# IMPLEMENT: Recurrent (for WM in RLPM model)
# IMPLEMENT: RL (vs. BP):
#                0) Linear layer as penultimate layer (one for which output weights will be modified);
#                       (note: slope gets parameterState that is controlled by learning_rate of LearningProjection)
#                1) Use Softmax as final output layer
#                2) ComparatorMechanism:  constrain len(COMPARATOR_SAMPLE) = len(COMPARATOR_TARGET) = 1
#                          (rather than len(terminalMechanism.outputState)
#                3) FullConnectivity MappingProjection from terminalMechanism->ComparatorMechanism
#                4) LearningProjection.learningRate sets slope of Linear layer
#                ----------------
#
#                REVISED VERSION:
#
#                0) Inputs (stimuli, actions) project to expected reward using identity matrix
#                1) Softmax on expected reward array
#                2) Pick one element probabilistically [IMPLEMENT] and use that one to set output of expected reward:
#                    - calculate cumulative sum (in order of options);
#                    - then draw random num (from uniform distribution),
#                    - pick first one whose cum sum is above the random number
#                    Note: NOT expected utility; i.e., softmax is just a decision rule, not a probability estimator
#                3) Compare that reward with the one received
#                4) Update the reward prediction (input weights) of the chosen action only (not the others)
#
#                 Other versions:
#                 one in which the reward goes to infinity (how do to that?)
#                 one in which probability of softmax is learned - but isn’t that what is happening here?
